## Overview

**Neolamprologus multifasciatus**, often referred to as "Multies" or Shell-Dwelling Cichlids, are one of the smallest
cichlids in the world. Originating from Lake Tanganyika, these fish are beloved for their unique behavior of living and
breeding inside snail shells. Their small size and fascinating social interactions make them a favorite among aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Multies require a tank as small as 60 liters, making them ideal for nano setups. They thrive in aquariums with a sandy
substrate and an abundance of empty snail shells for shelter. Maintain the water temperature at 24-27Â°C, pH between
7.8-9.0, and a hardness of 8-20 dGH. Proper filtration and weekly water changes are essential for their health.

## Feeding and Diet

These fish are omnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates, plankton, and algae in the wild. In captivity, they will
readily accept high-quality flakes or pellets designed for cichlids, as well as live or frozen foods like brine shrimp,
daphnia, and cyclops.

## Care and Maintenance

Neolamprologus multifasciatus are relatively easy to care for, provided their specific habitat needs are met. Use a
sandy substrate to allow them to move and arrange shells as part of their natural behavior. Keep the tank clean with
regular water changes and avoid overcrowding.

## Compatibility

Multies are generally peaceful but can become territorial around their shells. They are best kept in species-only tanks
or with other non-aggressive Lake Tanganyika species. Avoid pairing them with larger or more aggressive fish that may
outcompete them for food or space.

## Breeding

Breeding Multies is straightforward under the right conditions. They are shell spawners, with females laying their eggs
inside a chosen shell. The male fertilizes the eggs, and both parents guard the fry. Provide plenty of shells to
encourage breeding, and feed the fry with baby brine shrimp or finely crushed flake food.
