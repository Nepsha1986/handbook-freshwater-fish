## Overview

_Barbonymus schwanenfeldii_, or the Tinfoil Barb, is one of the largest barb species available in the aquarium trade.
This fish originates from rivers and lakes of Southeast Asia: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Borneo. In the wild, it
inhabits fast-flowing rivers and flooded plains, forming large shoals.

The body is deep and laterally compressed, covered with large silver scales that have a distinctive metallic sheen —
hence the common name "Tinfoil Barb." The caudal and anal fins are bright red or orange. Adults reach 30–35 cm and live
10–12 years. As with the [Bala Shark](/en/balantiocheilos-melanopterus), beginner aquarists often buy small juveniles of
5–8 cm without realizing how large the fish will actually grow.

## Tank Requirements

A school of 5–6 fish requires an aquarium of at least 600 liters. Tank length should be no less than 180 cm, as these
are active swimmers that need room to maneuver. Optimal water parameters: temperature 22–28°C, pH 6.5–7.5, hardness GH
5–15. Powerful filtration with current is essential — this simulates natural river conditions and handles the
significant biological load of large fish.

Use sand or fine gravel as substrate. Live plants are impractical — Tinfoil Barbs are notorious for eating and uprooting
most plant species. If you want greenery, only tough species like Anubias and Java fern attached to rocks and driftwood
will survive. Decorations should be large and stable — heavy rocks and driftwood for shelter. A tight-fitting lid is
mandatory, as startled fish may jump.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Barbonymus schwanenfeldii_ is an omnivore with a strong herbivorous tendency. The fish eat aquatic plants,
fallen fruits, algae, as well as small invertebrates and detritus. In the aquarium, high-quality pellets for large fish
form the staple diet. Be sure to include a vegetable component: blanched spinach, lettuce, scalded zucchini, peas, and
spirulina-based foods.

Supplement dry food with frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Feed twice daily in portions consumed within 3–5
minutes. Keep in mind that a school of 5–6 large fish consumes a substantial amount of food — this is a significant
ongoing cost. If there are live plants in the tank, the fish will actively eat them, so vegetable supplements in the
diet help reduce damage to the aquascape.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25–30% are essential. The biological load from a school of large fish is considerable, so
filtration should be oversized. Vacuum the substrate regularly and test water parameters: ammonia and nitrites at zero,
nitrates below 25 mg/l.

The Tinfoil Barb is quite hardy and rarely falls ill when conditions are stable. The main issue is stress from
insufficient tank volume or solitary keeping. Stressed fish lose their coloration, become skittish, and are susceptible
to bacterial infections. During tank maintenance, move calmly — startled large barbs can injure themselves thrashing
around the aquarium.

## Compatibility

The Tinfoil Barb is a schooling fish that must be kept in groups of at least 5–6 individuals. When kept alone or in
small numbers, the fish becomes stressed and may display nervousness. Good tankmates include other large peaceful
species: [Bala Shark](/en/balantiocheilos-melanopterus), [Clown Loach](/en/chromobotia-macracanthus), large
[gouramis](/en/trichopodus-leerii), and medium-sized peaceful cichlids.

Strictly avoid keeping with small fish — neons, rasboras, small tetras, and small barbs will be seen as food by adult
Tinfoil Barbs. Also consider that these active, large fish may stress slow-moving or timid tankmates.

## Breeding

Breeding _Barbonymus schwanenfeldii_ at home is extremely difficult (difficulty 4 out of 5). In the wild, spawning
occurs in large rivers during the rainy season when fish undertake upstream spawning migrations. Replicating these
conditions would require an enormous tank with simulation of seasonal changes.

This is an egg-scattering species — the female releases eggs into the water column and the male fertilizes them. Parents
show no care for offspring and may eat their own eggs. Commercial breeding takes place on large farms in Southeast Asia,
often using hormonal stimulation. Virtually all fish in the trade are farm-bred.
