## Overview

The Siamese Algae Eater (_Crossocheilus siamensis_) is a highly regarded freshwater fish, known for its natural algae
control capabilities. Originating from fast-flowing rivers in Southeast Asia, it is a slender, active fish with a
distinctive black stripe that extends from head to tail. Its reputation for efficiently consuming algae makes it a
popular choice for aquariums aiming to maintain a clean environment.

## Tank Requirements

The Siamese Algae Eater requires a minimum tank size of 100 liters, with a temperature range of 24-26Â°C, a pH between
6.0 and 7.5, and a GH of 5-20. They prefer a well-aerated tank with moderate to strong water flow, replicating their
natural riverine habitat. They appreciate a tank setup with plenty of plants, rocks, and driftwood, providing hiding
spots and surfaces for algae to grow.

## Feeding and Diet

Although primarily algae eaters, Siamese Algae Eaters benefit from a balanced diet that includes algae wafers, fresh
vegetables (like zucchini or cucumber), and occasional protein sources such as brine shrimp or bloodworms. This variety
helps keep them healthy and active in the aquarium.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Siamese Algae Eaters is relatively easy. Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and a strong filtration system
are essential to maintain water quality. Their active nature means they prefer spacious tanks, and maintaining good
water flow helps mimic their natural habitat.

## Compatibility

Siamese Algae Eaters are generally peaceful and do well in community tanks. They can be kept with other non-aggressive
species such as tetras, ras
