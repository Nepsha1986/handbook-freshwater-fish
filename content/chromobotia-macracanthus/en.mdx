## Overview

The Clown Loach, scientifically known as _Chromobotia macracanthus_, is a vibrant and active fish from the Botiidae
family. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo and Sumatra, this species is known for its striking orange and
black striped pattern and playful behavior. Clown Loaches are highly sought after for community tanks due to their
engaging and social nature.

## Tank Requirements

Clown Loaches require a spacious tank, with a minimum volume of 200 liters, to accommodate their size and active
behavior. Maintain water temperatures between 24°C and 28°C, with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH level
ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. Provide a well-decorated tank with hiding spots, as Clown Loaches enjoy having places to
retreat and explore.

## Feeding and Diet

Clown Loaches are omnivorous and thrive on a varied diet. Feed them high-quality pellets or flakes, supplemented with
live or frozen foods such as worms, shrimp, and other protein sources. Offer food once or twice a day and ensure any
uneaten food is removed to prevent water quality issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care includes checking water quality and feeding the fish. Perform weekly water changes (about 25% of the tank
volume) and clean the tank to prevent algae buildup. Monitor the health of Clown Loaches for signs of common issues like
skin infections or parasites and consult an aquatic specialist if needed.

## Compatibility

Clown Loaches are generally peaceful and do well with other non-aggressive community fish such as tetras, rasboras, and
larger peaceful species. Avoid keeping them with very small fish that might be eaten or overly aggressive species that
could cause stress or harm.

## Breeding

Breeding Clown Loaches in captivity is challenging and rarely accomplished. They require specific conditions and are
best bred in large, well-maintained setups that mimic their natural habitat. Breeding usually occurs in the wild, and
attempts in captivity are often unsuccessful without detailed knowledge of their breeding requirements.
