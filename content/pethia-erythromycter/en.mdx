## Overview

**Pethia erythromycter**, commonly known as the **Red-finned Barb**, is a small freshwater fish native to streams and
rivers in Southeast Asia. This fish is well-loved for its vibrant red fins and its peaceful, schooling nature, making it
a popular choice for community tanks. Growing up to 5 cm, it is a perfect option for smaller tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Red-finned Barbs are hardy fish that thrive in water temperatures ranging from 22-26°C. They require a tank with a
minimum volume of 60 liters, with a pH level between 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-12. Since they are active
swimmers, provide ample swimming space along with some plants for hiding. A well-aerated tank with a moderate water flow
will help replicate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Pethia erythromycter** feeds on small invertebrates, plant matter, and algae. In aquariums, they will
accept a variety of foods, including quality flakes, pellets, and live or frozen options such as daphnia, brine shrimp,
and bloodworms. A varied diet is essential for keeping them healthy and enhancing their colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Pethia erythromycter** is relatively easy, making it suitable for beginners. Regular water changes of about
20-30% per week will help maintain optimal water conditions. A good filtration system is also necessary to keep the
water clean. These fish are not particularly sensitive to water parameters, but stable, clean water is crucial for their
long-term health.

## Compatibility

Red-finned Barbs are peaceful and do best when kept in groups of six or more. They are compatible with other peaceful
species like tetras, rasboras, and small gouramis. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive species, as this may
stress them out. Their schooling nature also helps reduce aggression among themselves.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pethia erythromycter** in captivity can be moderately challenging. They are egg scatterers and require
slightly warmer water around 24-26°C for spawning. Use a breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water and fine-leaved
plants where the eggs can settle. Once the eggs are laid, it is essential to remove the adults to prevent them from
eating the eggs. The eggs usually hatch within 24-48 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food.
