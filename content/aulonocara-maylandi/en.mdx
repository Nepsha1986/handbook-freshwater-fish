## Overview

_Aulonocara maylandi_ is one of the most recognizable members of the Aulonocara genus found in Lake Malawi. Its defining
feature is a vivid sulfur-yellow patch on the forehead that contrasts beautifully with the blue-grey body. Males develop
especially intense coloration during spawning, while females remain more subdued in silvery-grey tones with a slight
yellowish hue. Adults reach 10–12 cm in length and live 5–8 years with proper care.

In the wild, this fish inhabits transitional zones between rocky and sandy areas of the lake at depths of 5–15 meters.
It stays near the bottom, sifting through sand in search of small invertebrates. Compared to other Malawi cichlids, the
Sulfur-Head Peacock has a relatively peaceful disposition, making it an excellent choice for a community cichlid tank.

## Tank Requirements

A group of one male and 2–3 females requires an aquarium of at least 150 liters. Optimal water parameters are:
temperature 24–28°C, pH 7.5–8.5, and hardness GH 10–20. These fish are sensitive to water quality, so powerful
filtration with good biological media is essential.

Fine sand works best as substrate — Aulonocara love to sift it through their gills while foraging. Create shelters using
rock piles to form caves and grottos, but leave enough open swimming space. Live plants struggle in a Malawi setup,
though hardy species like Anubias attached to rocks can work well.

## Feeding and Diet

In nature, _Aulonocara maylandi_ is a micro-predator feeding on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and worms found in
sandy substrate. In the aquarium, the staple diet should consist of high-quality cichlid pellets with good protein
content.

Supplement dry food with frozen brine shrimp, bloodworms, and cyclops — this helps maintain vibrant coloration and
overall vitality. Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions that are consumed within 2–3 minutes. Avoid overfeeding, as
Aulonocara are prone to digestive issues. A weekly fasting day is beneficial.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25–30% are the foundation of successful Malawi cichlid keeping. Use a gravel vacuum to clean the
sandy substrate of food remnants and waste. Test water parameters regularly — ammonia and nitrites should read zero, and
nitrates should stay below 20 mg/l.

Pay special attention to preventing Malawi bloat, a common disease in Malawi cichlids caused by poor diet or degraded
water quality. Watch for warning signs: refusal to eat, lethargy, and abdominal swelling all call for immediate action.
Maintaining stable water parameters and a balanced diet is the best prevention.

## Compatibility

The Sulfur-Head Peacock is one of the most peaceful Malawi cichlids. It coexists well with other Aulonocara species such
as the [Emperor Cichlid](/en/aulonocara-nyassae) or [Malawi Butterfly](/en/aulonocara-jacobfreibergi), as well as
peaceful mbuna like the [Yellow Lab](/en/labidochromis-caeruleus).

Avoid keeping them with aggressive species like the [Golden Mbuna](/en/melanochromis-auratus) or
[Zebra Mbuna](/en/pseudotropheus-zebra), which will bully the calmer Aulonocara. Small fish that could become prey
should also be avoided. The ideal setup is a harem of one male with several females, complemented by other peaceful
Malawi cichlids of similar size.

## Breeding

_Aulonocara maylandi_ is a maternal mouthbrooder. The male selects a flat rock or clears a patch of sand and courts the
female with vivid coloration and a characteristic dance. After spawning, the female collects the fertilized eggs in her
mouth and incubates them for 18–21 days.

During this period, the female does not eat, so it is important that she is in good condition before spawning. The
released fry are already fairly large and independent, but moving the brooding female to a separate tank improves
survival rates. Starter food for fry includes baby brine shrimp and crushed flakes. With good care, juveniles grow
quickly and begin showing color at 4–6 months.
