## Overview

The Sulfur-Head Peacock Cichlid (_Aulonocara maylandi_), also known as Mayland's Peacock, is a captivating species known
for its distinctive yellow “sulfur” marking on the head. Native to the rocky regions of Lake Malawi in Africa, this
cichlid is relatively peaceful for a peacock cichlid, although males can be territorial. Its vibrant colors and moderate
care requirements make it a great choice for intermediate aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Sulfur-Head Peacocks thrive in a well-maintained aquarium of at least 150 liters. They prefer warm water temperatures
between 24-28°C, a pH range of 7.5-8.5, and moderate to hard water (GH 10-20). A sandy substrate with rocky caves and
hiding places mimics their natural habitat, allowing them to feel secure. Strong filtration and regular water changes
are essential to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Aulonocara maylandi_ feeds on small invertebrates and crustaceans. In captivity, they enjoy a diet of
high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms. Providing a varied diet
ensures vibrant coloration and promotes overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

While hardy, Sulfur-Head Peacocks need stable water conditions and regular maintenance. Weekly water changes of 20-30%
and periodic tank cleaning will help maintain optimal health. Keep an eye out for common cichlid ailments, such as
Malawi bloat, which can be prevented with good water quality and a balanced diet.

## Compatibility

Sulfur-Head Peacocks are generally peaceful but may display territorial behaviors, particularly during breeding. They
can be kept with other non-aggressive African cichlids of similar size. Avoid housing them with highly aggressive or
very small, delicate fish to reduce stress and territorial conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara maylandi_ is achievable in a well-maintained aquarium. They are mouthbrooders, with females
carrying fertilized eggs in their mouths until they hatch. For successful breeding, provide a stable environment, plenty
of hiding spots, and a nutritious diet. Removing the fry to a separate tank can help increase survival rates, as adult
fish may prey on them.
