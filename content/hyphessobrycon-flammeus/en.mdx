## Overview

Hyphessobrycon flammeus, commonly known as the Flame Tetra, is a small and vibrant fish native to the Rio Orinoco and
Rio Negro basins in South America. Its bright orange-red body, accentuated by a black stripe and a brilliant red tail,
makes it a standout species in the aquarium. Flame Tetras are peaceful and social, making them an excellent choice for
community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Flame Tetras thrive in a well-maintained tank with plenty of plants and hiding spots. A minimum tank size of 40 liters
is recommended to provide ample swimming space. The ideal water temperature ranges from 24-28°C, with a pH between 6.0
and 7.5. Use a soft substrate and provide good filtration to maintain water quality. Regular water changes and a
well-planted environment will help replicate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Hyphessobrycon flammeus is an omnivorous species with a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects, worms, and
plant matter. In the aquarium, they will accept high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and live or frozen foods such as
brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Offering a diverse diet will enhance their coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Flame Tetras involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. Perform weekly water
changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Regularly check water parameters and address any issues promptly.
Monitor for common health issues such as fin rot or ich, and provide treatment as needed to ensure a thriving tank
environment.

## Compatibility

Flame Tetras are known for their peaceful and social nature, making them ideal for community tanks with other small,
non-aggressive fish. They can coexist with species such as other tetras, rasboras, and dwarf cichlids. Avoid keeping
them with larger or more aggressive fish that may view them as prey. Keeping them in groups of at least six will help
them feel secure and exhibit natural behaviors.

## Breeding

Breeding Hyphessobrycon flammeus in captivity requires some preparation. Set up a separate breeding tank with soft,
slightly acidic water and a temperature around 26-28°C. Provide spawning mops or fine-leaved plants where the fish can
lay eggs. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from consuming the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 3-4
days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or powdered fry food until they are large enough to eat regular foods.
