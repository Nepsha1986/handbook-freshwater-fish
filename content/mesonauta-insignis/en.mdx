## Overview

**Mesonauta insignis**, commonly called the _Flag Cichlid_ or _Royal Flag Cichlid_, is a medium-sized South American
cichlid. It is admired for its striking body pattern and gentle temperament, making it a great choice for community
aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

This species thrives in aquariums of 200 liters or more, with soft, slightly acidic to neutral water. The ideal
temperature ranges from 24 to 28Â°C, and the pH should be maintained between 5.5 and 7.5. Use driftwood, rocks, and
plants to replicate their natural Amazonian habitat, ensuring plenty of swimming space.

## Feeding and Diet

Flag Cichlids are omnivorous and will accept a variety of foods. A balanced diet includes high-quality flakes or
pellets, live or frozen foods like bloodworms and brine shrimp, and occasional vegetable-based offerings such as
blanched spinach or peas.

## Care and Maintenance

Mesonauta insignis is relatively hardy but sensitive to poor water conditions. Regular water changes and efficient
filtration are essential to keep the water parameters stable. They are peaceful and coexist well with similarly sized,
non-aggressive fish.

## Compatibility

This species is an excellent choice for community tanks. They can be housed with other peaceful cichlids, tetras, and
catfish. Avoid overly aggressive or much smaller tankmates, as they may disrupt the calm environment.

## Breeding

Breeding Mesonauta insignis is challenging but achievable in home aquariums. They are substrate spawners, laying eggs on
flat surfaces like rocks or large leaves. Both parents actively guard the eggs and fry. To encourage spawning, maintain
stable water parameters and offer high-protein live or frozen foods.
