## Overview

**Paratilapia polleni**, commonly known as the **Polleni Cichlid** or **Starry Night Cichlid**, is a beautiful and hardy
fish species endemic to Madagascar. Its striking appearance, with dark black or blue body covered in bright star-like
spots, makes it a favorite among aquarists. Growing up to 15-30 cm, it requires a large tank and is best suited for
intermediate-level hobbyists due to its semi-aggressive behavior and specific care requirements.

## Tank Requirements

The **Polleni Cichlid** thrives in a spacious aquarium of at least 300 liters. The water temperature should be
maintained between 23-27°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-15. A well-decorated tank with
rocks and hiding spots is ideal, and a sandy substrate is recommended to mimic its natural habitat. Good filtration is
necessary to maintain water quality, as these cichlids produce a considerable amount of waste.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Paratilapia polleni** feeds on small fish, invertebrates, and plant matter. In the aquarium, they can be
fed a varied diet of high-quality pellets, frozen or live foods like shrimp, krill, and earthworms. A well-balanced diet
with occasional vegetable-based foods is important for their overall health. Feed them twice a day, and ensure food
portions are appropriate for their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes are crucial for keeping the **Polleni Cichlid** healthy, as they are sensitive to poor water
quality. Perform 20-30% water changes weekly to maintain optimal conditions. Monitoring water parameters is important to
prevent stress-related diseases. These cichlids are territorial, especially during breeding, so provide plenty of hiding
spots to reduce aggression among tank mates.

## Compatibility

**Paratilapia polleni** can be kept with other robust, semi-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include other large
cichlids, catfish, and similarly sized fish that can hold their own. Avoid housing them with small, peaceful species, as
they may be seen as prey. During breeding, they can become highly territorial, so it's best to keep them in a
species-specific tank or provide sufficient space for other fish to escape.

## Breeding

Breeding **Paratilapia polleni** can be challenging, as they require specific conditions. A temperature of around
26-27°C and plenty of secluded areas will encourage spawning. Pairs will form strong bonds, and the female will lay eggs
on a flat surface, which both parents will guard aggressively. Once the fry hatch, they can be fed finely crushed food
like baby brine shrimp. Be cautious of the parents' aggression during this period.
