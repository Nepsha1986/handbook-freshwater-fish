## Overview

Gyrinocheilus aymonieri, commonly referred to as the Siamese Algae Eater or Chinese Algae Eater, is a hardy and active
fish that is well-known for its ability to keep algae under control in an aquarium. Native to Southeast Asia, this
species has a unique, elongated body and a sucker-like mouth adapted for grazing on surfaces. While they are primarily
algae eaters, their diet can be supplemented with other foods as they mature. They are a good choice for larger tanks,
as they can grow quite large and become territorial with age.

## Tank Requirements

The Siamese Algae Eater thrives in aquariums that closely replicate its natural riverine habitat, with a temperature
range of 23-28°C, pH between 6.5-7.5, and water hardness of 5-19 dGH. A minimum tank size of 200 liters is recommended
to provide ample space for swimming and foraging. The tank should be well-aerated with a good water flow, and include
plenty of hiding spots created with rocks, driftwood, and dense plantings. Because they can become territorial,
especially as they age, it’s important to provide plenty of space and visual barriers.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Gyrinocheilus aymonieri primarily feeds on algae, which they scrape off rocks and other
surfaces. In the aquarium, they will continue to graze on algae, but their diet should be supplemented with high-quality
sinking pellets, algae wafers, and occasional vegetable matter such as blanched zucchini or spinach. As they mature,
they may also accept live or frozen foods like bloodworms and brine shrimp. It's important to ensure they are receiving
adequate nutrition, especially in tanks where algae growth is minimal.

## Care and Maintenance

While Gyrinocheilus aymonieri is a relatively hardy species, they require stable water conditions and regular tank
maintenance to thrive. Weekly water changes of 20-25% are recommended to maintain high water quality. Monitoring water
parameters is important, especially in terms of maintaining a stable pH and temperature. The tank should be securely
covered, as these fish can be strong jumpers. Additionally, as they grow, their territorial behavior may increase, so
it's important to monitor their interactions with other tank mates and adjust the tank setup as necessary.

## Compatibility

Gyrinocheilus aymonieri can be kept with a variety of tank mates, but it is important to choose companions carefully.
When young, they are generally peaceful, but as they mature, they can become territorial, particularly towards other
bottom-dwelling species. Ideal tank mates include larger, non-aggressive species that inhabit the upper or middle levels
of the tank, such as larger tetras or peaceful cichlids. Avoid keeping them with small, slow-moving fish or species with
long fins, as they may become targets of aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Gyrinocheilus aymonieri in captivity is extremely rare and difficult. They are egg scatterers in the wild, but
very few successful breeding attempts have been documented in home aquariums. Typically, spawning would require very
specific conditions that are hard to replicate in a typical aquarium setting. Due to their size and territorial nature
as adults, even if breeding is attempted, a separate breeding tank would be necessary to increase the chances of
success.
