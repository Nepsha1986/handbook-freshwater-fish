## Overview

**Inpaichthys kerri**, commonly known as the **Kerri Tetra**, is a small and vibrant freshwater fish native to the
Amazon Basin in South America. This species is notable for its striking coloration, which includes a mix of bright
blues, greens, and reds. Growing up to 3-4 cm in length, the Kerri Tetra is a popular choice for community aquariums due
to its peaceful nature and attractive appearance.

## Tank Requirements

**Inpaichthys kerri** thrives in a well-planted aquarium with a minimum volume of 60 liters. The ideal water temperature
ranges from 22-26Â°C, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 and water hardness (GH) from 5-15. The tank should include plenty of
hiding spots and live plants to replicate their natural habitat. Regular water changes and a good filtration system are
essential to maintain optimal conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Kerri Tetras** feed on small invertebrates and aquatic insects. In captivity, they should be provided
with a varied diet that includes high-quality flake foods, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp, and
occasional vegetable matter. Feeding them 2-3 times a day will help keep them healthy and maintain their vibrant colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Inpaichthys kerri** involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a well-planted environment.
Regular water changes of 20-30% per week are recommended to ensure water quality. Monitor water parameters closely and
adjust as necessary to keep them within the ideal range. The Kerri Tetra is relatively hardy but can be sensitive to
sudden changes in water conditions.

## Compatibility

**Inpaichthys kerri** is a peaceful fish that can be kept with other non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include
other small tetras, rasboras, and peaceful community fish. Avoid keeping them with larger or more aggressive fish that
may bully or outcompete them for food. Providing ample swimming space and hiding spots will help reduce stress and
promote a harmonious tank environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Inpaichthys kerri** in captivity can be achieved with proper conditions. They are egg scatterers and will lay
their eggs among the plants in a separate breeding tank. The tank should have soft, slightly acidic water and be
well-planted to provide hiding spots for the eggs and fry. After spawning, the parents should be removed to prevent them
from eating the eggs. The fry are relatively easy to raise on infusoria and finely crushed food.
