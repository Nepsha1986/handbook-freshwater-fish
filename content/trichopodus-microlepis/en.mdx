## Overview

Trichopodus microlepis, commonly known as the Moonlight Gourami, is a large, peaceful freshwater fish native to the
slow-moving rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Cambodia. This species is easily
identified by its iridescent silver body, which can take on a subtle greenish or bluish hue depending on the lighting.
Moonlight Gouramis can grow up to 15-20 cm in length and are known for their graceful, slow swimming patterns. They are
popular in the aquarium trade for their calm demeanor and stunning appearance.

## Tank Requirements

Moonlight Gouramis require a spacious aquarium with a minimum capacity of 150 liters to accommodate their size and need
for swimming space. The ideal water temperature for this species ranges between 24-28°C, with a pH level of 6.0-7.5 and
general hardness (GH) between 5-15. These fish prefer a well-planted tank with plenty of hiding spots created by
driftwood, rocks, and live plants. Floating plants are particularly beneficial as they provide cover and help diffuse
the light, mimicking their natural habitat. A gentle water flow and efficient filtration are essential for maintaining
water quality, but ensure that the current is not too strong, as Moonlight Gouramis prefer calmer waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Trichopodus microlepis primarily feeds on insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter. In the aquarium,
they should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality pellets or flakes, along with live or frozen foods
such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. They may also nibble on soft plant leaves, so offering vegetable-based
foods like blanched spinach or zucchini can be beneficial. Feed them 2-3 times daily, ensuring they receive a balanced
diet to maintain their health and vibrant appearance.

## Care and Maintenance

Moonlight Gouramis are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for both novice and experienced aquarists.
Regular water changes of 20-30% per week are recommended to maintain optimal water conditions. These fish are labyrinth
breathers, meaning they can breathe air directly from the surface, so it's important to ensure there is enough surface
area for them to access air easily. Monitor water parameters regularly to avoid any sudden changes that could stress the
fish. Moonlight Gouramis are peaceful but can be shy, so providing ample hiding spaces is crucial for their well-being.

## Compatibility

Trichopodus microlepis is a peaceful species that does well in community tanks with other non-aggressive fish. Suitable
tank mates include other gouramis, peaceful cichlids, tetras, rasboras, and bottom dwellers like Corydoras catfish.
Avoid housing them with aggressive or fin-nipping species, as Moonlight Gouramis have long, delicate fins that can be
damaged. They can be kept in pairs or small groups, but it's important to ensure the tank is large enough to accommodate
multiple individuals.

## Breeding

Breeding Moonlight Gouramis in captivity is possible with the right conditions. A separate breeding tank with a water
temperature of around 26-28°C and a slightly acidic pH is recommended. The male will build a bubble nest at the water
surface, where he will entice the female to spawn. After spawning, the female should be removed to prevent her from
eating the eggs. The male will guard the nest and care for the eggs until they hatch in 24-36 hours. Once the fry are
free-swimming, the male should also be removed, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large
enough to consume baby brine shrimp.
