## Overview

Cichlasoma festae, commonly known as the Red Terror Cichlid, is a strikingly colorful and highly territorial species
native to the river systems of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. These cichlids are known for their
vibrant red and orange coloration, especially in females, which becomes more intense during breeding. They can grow up
to 30-35 cm in length, making them one of the larger cichlids in the aquarium hobby. Due to their aggressive nature,
they are best suited for experienced aquarists who can provide the necessary care and tank environment.

## Tank Requirements

Red Terror Cichlids require a spacious tank of at least 300 liters due to their large size and territorial behavior. The
ideal water temperature should be maintained between 24-28Â°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness between 6-15
dGH. The tank should be equipped with sturdy decorations like rocks and driftwood to provide hiding spots and establish
territories. A strong filtration system is also essential to maintain water quality, given their high bio-load.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Cichlasoma festae are omnivorous, feeding on a diet of insects, small fish, and plant matter. In captivity,
they should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with live or frozen
foods such as bloodworms, krill, and earthworms. Offering them vegetable matter, like blanched spinach or zucchini, will
help balance their diet. Feed them once or twice daily, ensuring not to overfeed, as they are prone to obesity.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining water quality is crucial for the health of Red Terror Cichlids. Perform weekly water changes of 20-30% and
regularly check water parameters to prevent the buildup of harmful substances. These cichlids are prone to stress and
disease if kept in poor conditions, so keeping the tank clean and providing a stable environment is essential. Watch for
signs of aggression, as they can inflict serious harm on tank mates.

## Compatibility

Cichlasoma festae is highly aggressive and territorial, especially during breeding. They are best kept in a species-only
tank or with other robust and similarly aggressive cichlids. Avoid keeping them with smaller or more peaceful species,
as they will likely be harassed or eaten. If housed with other fish, provide ample space and hiding spots to reduce
territorial disputes. It is recommended to keep them as a single specimen or in a bonded pair.

## Breeding

Breeding Red Terror Cichlids can be challenging due to their aggressive nature. A bonded pair should be provided with a
large tank and flat surfaces, such as rocks or slate, for spawning. The female will lay her eggs on a chosen surface,
which the male will then fertilize. The parents are highly protective of their eggs and fry, and aggression levels will
increase during this time. It is advisable to remove other tank mates to avoid conflict. The eggs will hatch in 3-4
days, and the fry can be fed with finely crushed flake food or newly hatched brine shrimp.
