## Overview

The Dario Loach (_Botia dario_) is a small yet vibrant species from the Botiidae family, native to Southeast Asia.
Growing to about 12 cm in length, this fish is known for its striking colors and active nature. It thrives in groups and
enjoys well-planted tanks with plenty of hiding spots. Dario Loach is ideal for community tanks with peaceful tank
mates, though it is recommended for experienced aquarists due to its care requirements.

## Tank Requirements

Dario Loach thrives in a tank of at least 80 liters, with a water temperature between 24-28°C. The water should have a
slightly acidic to neutral pH of 6.5-7.5 and moderate hardness (GH 6-12). Providing plenty of hiding spaces with plants,
rocks, and driftwood is essential, as this species is active and enjoys exploring its environment. A good filtration
system will also help maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

Dario Loach is omnivorous and will accept a variety of foods, including sinking pellets, flakes, live food (like worms
and brine shrimp), and frozen foods. In their natural habitat, they feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. It’s
important to offer a balanced diet to ensure they remain healthy and active.

## Care and Maintenance

These loaches are generally hardy but require regular maintenance. Perform weekly water changes to maintain good water
quality, and monitor water parameters to ensure stability. The fish are sensitive to drastic changes in water chemistry,
so gradual adjustments are best. They are relatively low-maintenance but thrive in a stable environment.

## Compatibility

Dario Loach is a peaceful species and generally does well with other calm fish. It is best kept with other
non-aggressive species such as tetras, rasboras, and peaceful barbs. Avoid keeping them with larger, more aggressive
fish, as they can be intimidated. They are social and should be kept in groups of at least three or four to encourage
natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Dario Loach in captivity is challenging and requires specific conditions. They are egg layers, but creating the
right environment for breeding can be difficult. Providing a well-planted tank with gentle filtration and slightly
acidic water can help trigger breeding behavior. After breeding, the eggs will hatch in a few days, and the fry will
need fine foods like infusoria to grow. It is recommended to separate the parents from the eggs to avoid predation.
