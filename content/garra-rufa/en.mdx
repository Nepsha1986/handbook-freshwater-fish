## Overview

Garra rufa, commonly known as Doctor Fish or Nibble Fish, is a freshwater species originating from the Middle East,
particularly Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. It has gained fame for its use in spa treatments, where it feeds on dead skin,
providing a gentle exfoliation. In the wild, Garra rufa inhabits warm, fast-moving rivers and streams. Their peaceful
nature and unique behavior make them an interesting addition to freshwater aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Garra rufa thrives in a minimum tank size of 80 liters. The ideal water temperature ranges between 22-28°C, with a pH
level of 6.5-8.0 and water hardness (GH) of 8-12 dGH. A strong water flow is recommended to mimic their natural
environment, and a substrate of fine gravel or sand is preferred. Rocks and driftwood can provide hiding spaces, while
plants can offer additional cover.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Garra rufa primarily feeds on algae and detritus, but in captivity, they can be fed a diet consisting of
algae wafers, blanched vegetables, and protein-rich foods like brine shrimp or bloodworms. It’s essential to supplement
their diet with varied foods to maintain their health and vitality in the aquarium.

## Care and Maintenance

Garra rufa is relatively easy to care for, requiring regular water changes and tank maintenance. A well-filtered tank
with good water flow is essential to keep them healthy. Routine monitoring of water parameters, along with a stable
temperature, will ensure the well-being of these fish.

## Compatibility

Garra rufa is a peaceful species and generally coexists well with other non-aggressive fish. However, they should not be
housed with overly aggressive species that may bully them. Good tank mates include other peaceful community fish such as
tetras, guppies, and mollies.

## Breeding

Breeding Garra rufa in home aquariums can be difficult, but it is possible with the right conditions. A separate
breeding tank with stable water parameters and increased water temperature may encourage spawning. The fry are tiny and
need to be fed specialized food like infusoria during their early stages of development.
