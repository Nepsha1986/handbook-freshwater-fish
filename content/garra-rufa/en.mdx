## Overview

Garra rufa (_Garra rufa_) is a small freshwater fish from the Cyprinidae family, widely known as the "Doctor Fish." In
the wild, it inhabits warm rivers and streams of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, preferring areas with moderate to strong
currents and rocky bottoms. Adults reach 10–12 cm in length and can live 5–7 years with proper care.

The body is elongated and torpedo-shaped, colored in grey-olive tones with a lighter belly. The mouth is positioned
downward and equipped with a sucker disc, which allows the fish to attach to rocks and scrape off biofilm and algae.
This unique feeding behavior brought Garra rufa worldwide fame in the spa industry, where it gently removes dead skin
cells.

In the aquarium hobby, _Garra rufa_ is valued for its peaceful nature, interesting behavior, and usefulness in algae
control. The fish is active during the day and spends most of its time near the bottom, exploring surfaces in search of
food.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females?

Sexual dimorphism in Garra rufa is subtle. Females are generally slightly larger and fuller, especially during spawning
season. Males tend to be slimmer and may be more active in behavior.

## Tank Requirements

A group of 5–6 individuals requires an aquarium of at least **80 liters**. _Garra rufa_ is a schooling fish that may
experience stress when kept alone, so a group of at least 5 is recommended.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature**: 22–28°C
- **pH**: 6.5–8.0
- **Hardness (dGH)**: 8–12

Fine gravel or sand works best as substrate. Decorations should include large rocks, smooth boulders, and driftwood —
the fish will actively explore their surfaces. It is important to provide good water flow using a powerhead or by
directing the filter output — this mimics their natural habitat. Plants can be included, with preference given to hardy,
tough-leaved species, as soft leaves may be damaged.

A tight-fitting lid is essential — Garra rufa can jump out of the water.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Garra rufa_ feeds primarily on biofilm, algae, and fine detritus. In the aquarium, the diet should consist
of:

- Spirulina-based tablets and algae wafers
- Blanched vegetables (zucchini, cucumber, spinach)
- Frozen and live foods (brine shrimp, bloodworms, daphnia) — as supplementary feeding

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions. Avoid overfeeding — the fish actively graze on algae growth within the aquarium
and partially feed on their own. A varied diet promotes vibrant coloration and good health.

## Care and Maintenance

Garra rufa is a fairly undemanding species with below-average care requirements. Key considerations:

- **Water changes**: 20–25% weekly
- **Filtration**: a powerful external or internal filter with good mechanical and biological media
- **Aeration**: the fish prefer oxygen-rich water, so an air pump or additional aeration is beneficial
- **Lighting**: moderate, sufficient to promote algae growth on decorations

Regularly test water parameters. _Garra rufa_ is sensitive to elevated nitrate and ammonia levels, so keep the substrate
clean and avoid overstocking the aquarium.

## Compatibility

_Garra rufa_ is a peaceful species that works well in a community tank with other calm fish. Good tank mates include:

- [Neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi) and other small tetras
- [Zebra danios](/en/danio-rerio) and other danios
- [Corydoras](/en/corydoras-aeneus) — peaceful bottom dwellers
- [Rasboras](/en/rasbora-brigittae)
- [Guppies](/en/poecilia-reticulata)

Avoid keeping them with large aggressive cichlids and territorial bottom-dwelling fish such as
[Red-tailed Black Shark](/en/epalzeorhynchos-bicolor), which may compete for bottom territory.

Within the school, Garra rufa may display mild hierarchy, occasionally chasing each other, but this is normal behavior
that does not result in injuries.

## Breeding

Breeding _Garra rufa_ in home aquariums is a moderately challenging task that requires patience and preparation. To
stimulate spawning:

- Set up a separate breeding tank of at least 40 liters
- Raise the temperature by 2–3°C above the usual range
- Increase live food feeding for 1–2 weeks prior to spawning
- Provide good aeration and fine substrate on the bottom

The female deposits eggs on rocks and hard surfaces. After spawning, it is advisable to remove the parents, as they may
eat the eggs. Fry hatch within 2–3 days and initially feed on their yolk sacs. They should then be fed infusoria and
microworms, gradually transitioning to baby brine shrimp.
