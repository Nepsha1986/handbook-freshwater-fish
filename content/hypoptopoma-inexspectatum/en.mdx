## Overview

**Hypoptopoma inexspectatum**, also known as the _Unexpected Hypoptopoma_, is a small, peaceful armored catfish from the
Loricariidae family. Native to slow-moving rivers and streams in South America, it is valued by aquarists for its
algae-eating habits and calm disposition, making it an excellent addition to planted community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

This species thrives in aquariums of at least 60 liters with soft to moderately hard water (GH 4–12) and a pH range of
6.0–7.5. Temperatures should be maintained between 22 and 28°C. Provide a well-decorated tank with live plants,
driftwood, and smooth rocks to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Hypoptopoma inexspectatum is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and biofilm. In an aquarium, supplement their diet
with high-quality algae wafers, blanched vegetables like zucchini and spinach, and occasional protein-based foods such
as bloodworms or brine shrimp.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is hardy and relatively easy to care for, provided water parameters remain stable. Regular water changes
and good filtration are essential to maintain water quality. Avoid overly bright lighting, as this species prefers dimly
lit environments with plenty of hiding spots.

## Compatibility

The Unexpected Hypoptopoma is a peaceful species that coexists well with other small, non-aggressive fish. Ideal
tankmates include tetras, rasboras, dwarf cichlids, and other small catfish. Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive
species.

## Breeding

Breeding Hypoptopoma inexspectatum in captivity is rare but possible. They are egg-layers that spawn on flat surfaces or
within crevices. To encourage spawning, maintain optimal water quality and temperature and provide plenty of hiding
spots for the females. The fry are delicate and require specialized care with algae or microfoods.
