## Overview

**Kryptopterus vitreolus**, commonly referred to as the Ghost Catfish, is a fascinating freshwater species native to the
rivers of Southeast Asia. Known for its transparent body, this fish can reach a size of 10-12 cm and has a lifespan of 5
to 7 years.

Ghost Catfish are generally peaceful and prefer to be kept in groups. They are a great addition to community tanks,
where they can exhibit their interesting behavior and unique appearance.

## Tank Requirements

**Kryptopterus vitreolus** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general
hardness (GH) of 5-10 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-28Â°C, and they should be housed in a
tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters.

Providing a well-planted aquarium with plenty of hiding spots is essential for these fish. They feel more secure in a
dimly lit environment with plenty of foliage and hiding places.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Kryptopterus vitreolus** are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and plant matter. In
captivity, they accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia.

To maintain their health, it is important to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich foods and vegetable
matter. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, offering only what they can consume within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Ghost Catfish are relatively easy to care for but require good water quality. Regular water changes of 20-30% each week
are necessary to maintain a clean environment. A reliable filtration system is essential for keeping the water
well-oxygenated.

Since they are peaceful fish, they do well in community tanks, but it's best to avoid aggressive species that may harass
them.

## Compatibility

**Kryptopterus vitreolus** are best kept with other peaceful fish that share similar water parameters. Suitable
tankmates include tetras, barbs, and smaller cichlids. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive species, as they may
become stressed or harassed.

Providing ample hiding spots will help these fish feel secure and reduce stress in the aquarium environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Kryptopterus vitreolus** in captivity is challenging, as they require specific conditions to spawn. A
separate breeding tank with suitable spawning sites, such as fine-leaved plants, is recommended.

If breeding is successful, the female will scatter eggs in the plants, and the fry should be fed infusoria or finely
crushed flakes once they are free-swimming. It's crucial to separate the fry from the adults to prevent them from being
eaten.
