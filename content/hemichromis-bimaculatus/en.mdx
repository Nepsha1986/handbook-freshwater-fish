## Overview

The African Jewelfish (_Hemichromis bimaculatus_), also known as the Two-Spotted Jewelfish, is native to the rivers and
lakes of West Africa. This species stands out with its vibrant colors, including rich reds and blues, and distinctive
two spots on the dorsal fin. It is known for its energetic and territorial behavior.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank volume of 100 liters is recommended for the African Jewelfish. Maintain a water temperature between 24°C
and 28°C, with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. The general hardness should be between 10 and 15 dGH. The tank should be
well-filtered and include hiding spots and territories, such as rocks and driftwood, to provide a comfortable
environment for the fish.

## Feeding and Diet

The African Jewelfish is primarily carnivorous but will accept a varied diet. In the wild, it feeds on small
invertebrates and fish. In captivity, provide high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and
bloodworms, and occasional vegetable matter. Feed them 2-3 times a day, ensuring a balanced diet for their health and
coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care involves checking water quality and feeding the fish. Weekly tasks include monitoring the filtration system,
performing partial water changes, and inspecting the fish for any signs of illness or stress. Common health issues
include fin rot and external parasites, which can be treated with appropriate medications.

## Compatibility

The African Jewelfish can be aggressive and territorial, so it is best kept with other medium-sized fish that can
tolerate its behavior. Suitable tank mates include other cichlids and robust, larger fish. Avoid keeping them with very
small or overly peaceful species that might become victims of aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding _Hemichromis bimaculatus_ in captivity requires a well-established tank with stable water conditions and hiding
places. Males will establish territories and display courtship behavior to attract females. The female will lay eggs on
a flat surface, and both parents will guard the eggs and fry once they hatch. Provide fine food and a safe environment
for the fry to ensure their successful growth.
