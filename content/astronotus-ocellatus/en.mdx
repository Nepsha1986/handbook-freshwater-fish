## Overview

_Astronotus ocellatus_ is one of the most recognizable and charismatic cichlids in the aquarium hobby worldwide. This
large species inhabits the Amazon, Orinoco, and other river basins of South America, where it favors slow-moving
stretches with soft bottoms, driftwood, and submerged vegetation.

The Oscar grows to 30–35 cm and lives 10–15 years, often longer with excellent care. The wild-type coloration is
olive-gray with orange-red spots and a characteristic eyespot (ocellus) at the base of the tail. Breeders have developed
numerous color morphs: tiger, red, albino, lutino, and others.

The Oscar's most remarkable trait is its exceptional intelligence for a fish. They quickly bond with their owner,
recognize them, take food from hand, and even tolerate being touched. Each fish has its own distinct character and
behavior, which is why Oscars are often called "water dogs." This is a true pet, not merely a decorative fish.

## Tank Requirements

Keeping a single _Astronotus ocellatus_ requires an aquarium of at least 300 liters, and a pair needs 400–500 liters.
This is a large, active fish that demands space. Optimal water parameters are: temperature 22–28 °C, pH 6.0–8.0, and
general hardness GH 10–20.

The aquarium must have a secure, tight-fitting lid — Oscars can jump out, especially when stressed. Use coarse substrate
such as gravel or coarse sand, as Oscars constantly dig and rearrange the bottom.

Decorations should be heavy and stable — large rocks and massive driftwood. Lightweight items will inevitably be moved
or overturned. Live plants rarely survive in an Oscar tank: the fish uproot and destroy them. The exception is
tough-leaved species like Anubias tied to rocks. Leave plenty of open space for swimming.

## Feeding and Diet

_Astronotus ocellatus_ is an omnivorous predator with an excellent appetite. In nature, the diet consists of fish,
insects, crustaceans, mollusks, and plant matter. In the aquarium, the staple diet should be high-quality pellets for
large cichlids — they provide balanced nutrition and are easy to portion.

Regularly supplement with live and frozen foods: large bloodworms, shrimp, fish fillet pieces, squid, and earthworms.
Oscars also readily accept vegetable supplements — blanched lettuce leaves, peas, and zucchini.

Feeding live feeder fish is strongly discouraged — it carries a high risk of introducing parasites and infections. Feed
adults 1–2 times daily in portions consumed within 2–3 minutes. One fasting day per week is beneficial. Overfeeding is a
common mistake among owners, leading to obesity and liver problems.

## Care and Maintenance

The Oscar is a demanding fish with a care level of 4 out of 5, and it is definitely not for beginners. The main
challenge is the enormous biological load: Oscars eat a lot and produce a significant amount of waste.

Powerful filtration is an absolute necessity. An external canister filter with a flow rate of at least 5–6 tank volumes
per hour is the minimum requirement. Weekly water changes of 30–40% are mandatory. Monitor water parameters regularly:
ammonia and nitrites must stay at zero, nitrates below 30 mg/l.

Oscars are prone to Hole-in-the-Head disease (HITH), which is linked to poor water quality and vitamin/mineral
deficiencies. A varied diet and clean water are the best prevention. Also watch the skin condition: the scaleless areas
of the head are susceptible to bacterial infections.

All equipment in the tank (heater, thermometer, air stones) must be securely fastened or protected — Oscars are capable
of breaking and displacing virtually anything.

## Compatibility

_Astronotus ocellatus_ has a behavior rating of 4 out of 5 — territorial and capable of significant aggression. Anything
that fits in an Oscar's mouth will be eaten — this is the most important rule when selecting tankmates.

Suitable companions are large, robust fish: [Severums](/en/heros-severus), [Green Terrors](/en/aequidens-rivulatus),
[Jack Dempseys](/en/rocio-octofasciata), large [Synodontis catfish](/en/synodontis-eupterus),
[Sailfin Plecos](/en/pterygoplichthys-gibbiceps), and [Striped Raphael Catfish](/en/platydoras-costatus). They also
coexist reasonably well with [Bichirs](/en/polypterus-bichir), which are protected by their tough scales.

Small fish — tetras, barbs, rasboras, livebearers — must never be kept with Oscars. They will be eaten on the first
night. Housing with small and medium cichlids such as [Angelfish](/en/pterophyllum-scalare) and
[Apistogramma](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides) is also inadvisable — they will become victims of aggression.

The best setup is a species-only tank with a pair of Oscars and 1–2 large companion catfish.

## Breeding

Breeding _Astronotus ocellatus_ is quite achievable with proper preparation — the difficulty is rated 3 out of 5. Oscars
are monogamous and form stable pairs, sometimes for life. The best way to obtain a pair is to raise a group of 5–6
juveniles and let them pair off naturally.

For spawning, prepare a tank of at least 300 liters with a flat rock or ceramic tile as a substrate. Water parameters:
temperature 26–28 °C, pH 6.5–7.0, and moderate hardness. Spawning can be triggered by generous live food feedings and
water changes with slightly cooler water, simulating the rainy season.

The female lays 1,000 to 3,000 eggs, which both parents diligently guard and fan with their fins. The eggs incubate for
3–4 days, and the fry become free-swimming within a week. First food should be baby brine shrimp and finely crushed
pellets.

Parental instinct in Oscars is usually well developed, but young pairs may eat their first few clutches. This is normal
— with experience, they become attentive parents. Fry grow quickly and reach 4–5 cm by three months of age.
