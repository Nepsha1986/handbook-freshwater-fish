## Overview

The Oscar _(Astronotus ocellatus)_, also known as the **Velvet Cichlid**, **Marble Cichlid**, or **Tiger Oscar**, is a
large and vibrant cichlid species native to South America. Found primarily in the slow-moving waters of the Amazon River
basin, these fish are known for their striking coloration, which can range from olive-green to dark brown with bright
red or orange markings. Oscars are highly intelligent and have a bold, interactive personality, making them a popular
choice among aquarium enthusiasts. They can grow up to 35 centimeters in length and have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years
when provided with proper care. Their natural habitat consists of warm, slightly acidic to neutral waters with plenty of
hiding spots and open spaces for swimming.

## Tank Requirements

Oscars require a spacious aquarium due to their large size and active nature. A minimum tank size of 200 liters (55
gallons) is recommended for a single Oscar, but larger tanks are preferable, especially if you plan to keep multiple
Oscars or other large fish. The water temperature should be maintained between 22-28°C to mimic their natural tropical
habitat. Oscars thrive in water with a general hardness (GH) of 10-20 and a pH range of 6.0-8.0.

It is essential to provide a well-filtered tank to manage the significant waste produced by these fish. Regular water
changes are crucial to maintaining water quality. Decorate the tank with sturdy plants, driftwood, and rocks, ensuring
there are plenty of hiding spots. However, avoid small, delicate plants as Oscars have a tendency to uproot and
rearrange their environment. Adding a secure lid is important as Oscars are known to be strong jumpers.

Overall, creating a stable and clean environment with ample swimming space and hiding spots will help keep your Oscars
healthy and thriving.

## Feeding and Diet

Oscars are omnivorous and have a hearty appetite, requiring a varied diet to maintain their health and vibrant
coloration. In the wild, they feed on a range of foods, including insects, crustaceans, small fish, and plant matter. In
captivity, a high-quality pellet or cichlid-specific food should form the staple of their diet.

To supplement their primary diet, offer a variety of live, frozen, or freeze-dried foods such as brine shrimp,
bloodworms, and krill. Additionally, occasional treats of fresh vegetables like peas, spinach, or zucchini can be
beneficial. Avoid feeding Oscars feeder fish, as they can introduce diseases and parasites into the tank.

Feed your Oscars two to three times a day, offering only as much food as they can consume within a few minutes to
prevent overfeeding and water quality issues. Proper nutrition is crucial for their growth, coloration, and overall
health, so ensure they receive a balanced and varied diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Oscars requires dedication and attention to detail to ensure they remain healthy and vibrant. Due to their
size and bio-load, maintaining pristine water conditions is crucial. Perform regular water changes of 20-30% weekly to
keep nitrate levels low and water quality high. Invest in a robust filtration system that can handle the substantial
waste Oscars produce.

Monitor water parameters regularly, ensuring the temperature stays within 22-28°C, the pH ranges between 6.0-8.0, and
the general hardness (GH) is maintained between 10-20. Use a reliable heater to maintain consistent temperatures and
consider a UV sterilizer to help control pathogens.

Oscars are prone to certain health issues such as Hole-in-the-Head disease and external parasites. Providing a balanced
diet, maintaining excellent water quality, and observing your fish for any signs of illness are essential preventive
measures. If you notice any symptoms, promptly address them with appropriate treatments.

Oscars are known to rearrange their environment and can be quite destructive with delicate decorations and plants. Use
sturdy tank decorations and ensure all equipment is securely placed to avoid accidents. Regularly inspect and clean the
tank, removing any debris and checking for signs of wear on equipment.

With proper care and maintenance, your Oscars can live a long and healthy life, providing endless enjoyment with their
unique behaviors and vibrant personalities.

## Compatibility

Oscars are known for their territorial and sometimes aggressive behavior, especially as they mature. Therefore, careful
consideration is needed when choosing tank mates. Suitable companions include other large, robust fish that can hold
their own, such as large cichlids (e.g., Severums, Jack Dempseys), large catfish, and certain species of large barbs.
Avoid housing Oscars with small fish, as they are likely to be seen as food. Additionally, avoid very aggressive or
overly territorial species that might provoke constant conflict.

Ensure the tank is spacious enough to accommodate all inhabitants, providing plenty of hiding spots and territories to
minimize aggression. Monitor interactions closely and be prepared to separate fish if aggression becomes a significant
issue.

## Breeding

Breeding Oscars can be a rewarding but challenging process. Oscars are monogamous and form strong pairs. To encourage
breeding, start with a group of juveniles and allow them to pair off naturally. Once a pair has formed, provide them
with their own tank to reduce stress and aggression from other fish.

The breeding tank should be at least 200 liters, with flat rocks or slate surfaces for egg-laying. Maintain water
conditions with a temperature of 26-28°C, a pH of 6.5-7.5, and soft to moderately hard water. Perform frequent water
changes to keep the environment clean.

Oscars typically lay between 1,000 to 3,000 eggs, which both parents will guard and fan to keep oxygenated. The eggs
hatch in 3-4 days, and the fry become free-swimming within a week. Feed the fry with newly hatched brine shrimp or
finely crushed flake food several times a day.

Parental care is generally excellent, but if the parents become overly aggressive or eat the eggs, you may need to
remove the eggs or fry to a separate rearing tank. With patience and proper care, breeding Oscars can be a fascinating
and fulfilling experience.
