## Overview

**Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor**, commonly known as the Egyptian Mouthbrooder or Dwarf Cichlid, is a colorful and lively
species from the freshwater habitats of Africa. They are known for their unique breeding behavior, in which the female
holds the fertilized eggs in her mouth until they hatch.

These small cichlids grow to about 5-7 cm and live for 5-7 years. They are relatively easy to care for and can thrive in
community tanks if provided with suitable tankmates and proper care.

## Tank Requirements

A 60-liter tank is sufficient for a pair of **Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor**, although larger tanks are recommended if
keeping multiple pairs or adding other species. They thrive in water temperatures between 22-28°C, with a GH of 8-15 and
a pH between 6.5-7.5.

Include rocks, caves, and plants to provide hiding spots and establish territories. These fish appreciate slightly
subdued lighting and the presence of fine gravel or sand substrate.

## Feeding and Diet

**Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor** are omnivores, and a varied diet will help keep them healthy and vibrant. Offer them
high-quality flakes or pellets along with frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. They also
enjoy small vegetable matter like spinach or peas.

Feed them small portions multiple times a day for optimal health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining good water quality is essential for **Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor**. Regular water changes, filtration, and
monitoring water parameters are key to keeping them healthy.

Because they are small and relatively peaceful, they do not require overly complicated tank setups, but care should be
taken to maintain stable water conditions.

## Compatibility

While **Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor** are territorial during breeding, they can be kept in community tanks with other
small, non-aggressive fish. Ideal tankmates include species like small tetras or rasboras. Avoid keeping them with
overly aggressive or much larger species that may outcompete them for food or territory.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor** is relatively easy, as they are mouthbrooders. The female carries the
fertilized eggs in her mouth until they hatch, which typically takes about 10-14 days.

Once the fry are released, they can be fed baby brine shrimp or finely crushed flake food. The parents will often guard
the fry for a short period, but it’s advisable to separate them for their safety.
