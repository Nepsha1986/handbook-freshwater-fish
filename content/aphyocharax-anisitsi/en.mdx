## Overview

The Bloodfin Tetra (_Aphyocharax anisitsi_) is a small yet eye-catching characin from the family Characidae. In the
wild, this species inhabits rivers and streams of the Paraná and Paraguay basins in South America, preferring areas with
moderate current and abundant vegetation.

The fish reaches a size of 4–5 cm and lives 5–8 years with proper care. The body is elongated and silvery with a
characteristic sheen. Its main adornment is the vivid blood-red anal, caudal, and ventral fins, which look especially
impressive in a school against a backdrop of green plants. Males are typically slimmer than females and display more
intense fin coloration.

_Aphyocharax anisitsi_ is one of the hardiest tetras available. Thanks to its resilience and peaceful temperament, this
fish has become a classic choice for community tanks and an excellent option for those just starting their journey in
the aquarium hobby.

## Tank Requirements

A group of 6–10 Bloodfin Tetras requires a tank of at least **60 liters**. These fish are active swimmers, so it is
important to leave plenty of open space for swimming in the upper and middle levels of the aquarium.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 22–28 °C (72–82 °F)
- **pH:** 6.0–8.0
- **Hardness (GH):** 5–15 dGH

A dark substrate — sand or fine gravel — works best, as it makes the fish's colors appear more vivid. Plants are an
essential part of the setup: vallisneria, cryptocorynes, and Java moss are all good choices. Floating plants create the
diffused lighting that _Aphyocharax anisitsi_ prefers over bright direct light. Small pieces of driftwood and rocks
provide additional shelter.

The current should be moderate — it mimics the natural habitat and encourages the fish to display their active behavior.

## Feeding and Diet

The Bloodfin Tetra is an omnivore that is not demanding when it comes to food. High-quality dry food — flakes or small
granules for tropical fish — can form the basis of its diet.

For optimal nutrition and vibrant coloration, regularly include the following:

- **Live and frozen foods:** bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and cyclops. These can be offered 2–3 times per week.
- **Plant-based supplements:** blanched spinach, spirulina, or foods with plant-based ingredients.

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions that the fish consume within 2–3 minutes. Overfeeding is a common mistake that
leads to deteriorating water quality. A fasting day once a week is beneficial.

## Care and Maintenance

Keeping _Aphyocharax anisitsi_ is straightforward even for beginning aquarists. Key care guidelines:

- **Filtration:** use an internal or external filter that provides moderate flow and effective biological filtration.
- **Aeration:** supplemental air supply is recommended, especially during warmer months.
- **Water changes:** replace 20–25% of the tank volume weekly with dechlorinated water. This keeps nitrate and nitrite
  levels low.
- **Substrate cleaning:** siphon the substrate during each water change to remove uneaten food and organic waste.

Test water parameters regularly. Bloodfin Tetras are hardy, but sudden parameter swings can cause stress and weaken
their immune system.

## Compatibility

The Bloodfin Tetra is a schooling fish with a peaceful disposition. It should be kept in a group of **at least 6
individuals** — in a school, the fish feel confident and display their natural behavior.

Excellent tankmates include:

- Other peaceful tetras: [neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [cardinal tetras](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi),
  [glowlight tetras](/en/hemigrammus-erythrozonus), [flame tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-flammeus)
- Small [rasboras](/en/rasbora-brigittae)
- [Corydoras catfish](/en/corydoras-aeneus) and other small bottom-dwellers
- Peaceful livebearers

Avoid housing them with large or aggressive fish — cichlids, large barbs, and predators. Also avoid fish with long,
flowing fins, as Bloodfin Tetras can occasionally nip the fins of slow-moving tankmates.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aphyocharax anisitsi_ at home is quite achievable and does not require extensive experience. Spawning is free
— the fish scatter eggs among plants.

**Preparation:**

- Set up a separate breeding tank of 15–20 liters with fine-leaved plants (Java moss, cabomba) or a spawning grid on the
  bottom.
- Water parameters for spawning: temperature 25–26 °C (77–79 °F), pH around 6.5, soft water (GH 4–8).
- For a week before spawning, condition the breeders with generous amounts of live food.

**Spawning and raising fry:**

Spawning typically occurs in the morning. The female scatters eggs among the plants, and the male fertilizes them. After
spawning, the parents must be removed, as they will eat their own eggs.

The eggs hatch in 24–36 hours. For the first few days, the larvae feed on their yolk sac. Once the yolk is absorbed
(days 3–4), the fry can be fed infusoria and liquid fry food. After 1–2 weeks, they are ready to accept baby brine
shrimp and finely crushed dry food.
