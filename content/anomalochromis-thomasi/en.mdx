## Overview

Anomalochromis Thomasi (_Anomalochromis thomasi_) is a small freshwater fish from the cichlid family, native to West
Africa, where it inhabits slow-moving rivers and streams. Adults reach a length of about 7–8 cm, making them one of the
smallest cichlids. This species is known for its bright coloration, which includes silvery-blue hues with orange and
black accents. Anomalochromis Thomasi is a peaceful fish that gets along well with other non-aggressive species. It is
suitable for beginner aquarists due to its hardiness and ease of care.

The main feature of Anomalochromis Thomasi is its bright coloration: the body has a silvery-blue shade with orange spots
on the fins and black stripes that become more pronounced during spawning. This species is also known for its
interesting behavior, including parental care, making it fascinating to observe.

### What Makes This Species Unique

- **Peaceful Nature**: Unlike many cichlids, Anomalochromis Thomasi is not aggressive towards other fish.
- **Parental Care**: The parents actively care for the eggs and fry, making the breeding process fascinating.
- **Hardiness**: This species adapts easily to various conditions, making it suitable for beginners.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females

Distinguishing males from females in Anomalochromis Thomasi is relatively easy, as sexual dimorphism is quite
pronounced:

**Main differences**:

- Males are larger and more brightly colored, especially during spawning. Their fins have more pronounced orange and
  black accents.
- Females are smaller and have a rounder belly.
- Males have more pointed dorsal and anal fins compared to females.

These signs will help you easily determine the sex of the fish.

## Care and Maintenance

Anomalochromis Thomasi is a hardy fish suitable for small aquariums. The minimum tank volume should be 60–80 liters for
a pair or small group. Water parameters should be as follows: temperature 24–28°C, pH 6.0–7.5, hardness 5–15 dGH.
Regular water changes (20–25% of the volume weekly) will help maintain cleanliness.

For comfortable keeping of Anomalochromis Thomasi, the following are necessary:

- **Filtration and Aeration**: The fish prefer clean water, so a medium-power filter is essential.
- **Substrate**: Use sand or fine gravel to create a natural environment.
- **Hiding Spots**: Driftwood, rocks, and plants (such as anubias or Java moss) will help the fish feel comfortable.

Anomalochromis Thomasi is peaceful and gets along well with other non-aggressive species, such as tetras, rasboras, and
small catfish.

## Diet and Nutrition

Anomalochromis Thomasi is an omnivorous fish. In the wild, it feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant
matter. In the aquarium, the diet should be varied:

- **Live and Frozen Foods**: Bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia.
- **Dry Foods**: High-quality flakes and pellets.
- **Plant-Based Foods**: Blanched vegetables (cucumber, zucchini) and foods with plant components.

Feed 1–2 times a day in small portions. A fasting day can be arranged once a week.

## Compatibility with Other Species

Anomalochromis Thomasi is a peaceful fish that gets along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tankmates
include:

- Small tetras
- Rasboras
- Corydoras
- Small gouramis

Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, as they may intimidate Anomalochromis. Also, avoid very small shrimp,
as they may be perceived as prey.

## Breeding in the Aquarium

Breeding Anomalochromis Thomasi in a home aquarium is relatively easy. This species forms stable pairs and actively
cares for its offspring. To stimulate spawning, it is recommended to:

- Increase the water temperature to 26–28°C.
- Provide flat stones or ceramic pots where the fish can lay their eggs.
- Increase the proportion of live and frozen foods in the diet.

After spawning, the pair will guard the eggs and fry. The eggs incubate for 2–3 days, and the fry begin swimming after
5–7 days. Feed them infusoria and brine shrimp nauplii.

## Helpful Tips for Aquarists

- **Create a Natural Environment**: Use driftwood, rocks, and plants to mimic the natural biotope.
- **Monitor Water Parameters**: Although Anomalochromis Thomasi is hardy, stable conditions will help maintain its
  health and vibrant coloration.
- **Observe Behavior**: This species is interesting for its social interactions and parental care, making it a great
  subject for observation.
