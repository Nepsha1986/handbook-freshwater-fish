## Overview

**Anomalochromis thomasi**, commonly known as the **African Butterfly Cichlid**, is a small and peaceful fish native to
West Africa. This species reaches a length of about 6-8 cm and is appreciated for its beautiful color patterns, which
include shades of yellow, blue, and red. It is a relatively peaceful member of the cichlid family and is well-suited for
community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

An **African Butterfly Cichlid** thrives in a tank of at least 80 liters, with a temperature range of 22-28°C. The water
should have a pH level of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) between 5-15. The tank should be well-planted, providing
hiding spots with rocks, driftwood, and vegetation. Moderate water flow and good filtration are necessary to maintain
water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Anomalochromis thomasi** feeds on small invertebrates, insects, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they
readily accept a varied diet consisting of high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods such as bloodworms,
brine shrimp, and daphnia. Providing a balanced diet helps maintain their vibrant coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is relatively easy to care for, making it a good choice for beginner aquarists. Regular water changes
(20-30% weekly) and maintaining clean water conditions are essential for their well-being. Watch for common diseases,
such as ich, and treat promptly if symptoms appear.

## Compatibility

The **African Butterfly Cichlid** is peaceful compared to other cichlid species and can be kept with other
non-aggressive tank mates. Suitable companions include small tetras, rasboras, and peaceful bottom dwellers like
Corydoras. Avoid housing them with large or overly aggressive species, as they may become stressed or territorial in
such setups.

## Breeding

Breeding **Anomalochromis thomasi** is relatively straightforward in a well-maintained aquarium. This species is a
substrate spawner, and pairs often form monogamous bonds. To encourage breeding, slightly raise the temperature to
26-28°C and provide flat surfaces or cave-like areas for spawning. The female will lay eggs, and both parents will guard
the fry until they become free-swimming. Once the fry are swimming freely, they can be fed with baby brine shrimp or
finely crushed flakes.
