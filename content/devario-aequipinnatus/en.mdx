## Overview

Devario aequipinnatus, also known as the Giant Danio or Malabar Danio, is a vibrant and active species native to
fast-moving streams and rivers of South Asia, particularly in India and Sri Lanka. Known for their impressive size and
bright coloration, these fish make excellent additions to larger freshwater tanks. Their streamlined bodies and active
swimming behavior require a spacious environment, and they are best kept in schools.

## Tank Requirements

The minimum recommended tank size for Devario aequipinnatus is 100 liters. They prefer water temperatures between
20-25Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness of 5-12 dGH. A tank with open swimming spaces, along with plants
and rocks for decoration, is ideal. Due to their energetic nature, they thrive in tanks with a strong current to mimic
their natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Giant Danios are omnivorous, feeding on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they
can be fed a varied diet of flakes, pellets, and live or frozen foods like brine shrimp or daphnia. It is important to
provide a mix of foods to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients.

## Care and Maintenance

Devario aequipinnatus is a relatively hardy species, making it easy to care for. Regular water changes and tank
maintenance are essential to keep them healthy. They prefer clean, well-oxygenated water with a good flow, so
maintaining a powerful filter is recommended.

## Compatibility

Giant Danios are peaceful but very active fish. They do well in community tanks with other fast-moving, non-aggressive
species like barbs and tetras. However, slower, more timid fish may find them stressful due to their constant movement.
Keeping them in schools of six or more will reduce stress and bring out their best behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Devario aequipinnatus is possible in captivity but can be challenging. They are egg scatterers and prefer
spawning in groups. A separate breeding tank with dense plants or spawning mops is recommended. After spawning, the
adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be
fed infusoria or other suitable small foods.
