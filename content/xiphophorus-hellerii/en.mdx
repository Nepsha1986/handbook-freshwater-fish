## Overview

The Swordtail Fish (Xiphophorus hellerii) is a popular freshwater species belonging to the Poeciliidae family. Native to
Central America, particularly in Mexico and Honduras, these fish are well-known for the male's elongated lower tail fin,
resembling a sword, which gives them their name. They are available in a variety of colors, including green, red, and
orange. Swordtail Fish are relatively peaceful, making them a great addition to community tanks. They grow to a length
of 10 to 14 cm and are known for their active and lively behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Swordtail Fish require a tank of at least 75 liters to thrive. They prefer water temperatures between 22-28Â°C, a pH
level of 7.0 to 8.2, and a water hardness (GH) between 10-25. A well-planted aquarium with plenty of swimming space is
ideal for these active swimmers. The tank should have a moderate water flow and efficient filtration. Adding floating
plants and providing hiding spots will help them feel more secure in their environment.

## Feeding and Diet

Swordtail Fish are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, consisting of plant matter, small invertebrates, and
algae. In an aquarium setting, they can be fed a combination of high-quality flake or pellet food, along with live or
frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. They also enjoy blanched vegetables like spinach or
zucchini. Feeding them a balanced diet will keep them healthy and maintain their vibrant colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Swordtail Fish is relatively easy, making them an excellent choice for beginner aquarists. Routine
maintenance includes weekly water changes of about 20-25% and keeping an eye on water parameters to ensure they remain
stable. Swordtails can be susceptible to common freshwater diseases like Ich, so regular observation for signs of
illness is important. Maintaining good water quality and providing a varied diet will help prevent most health issues.

## Compatibility

Swordtail Fish are generally peaceful and do well in community tanks. However, males can sometimes be territorial and
show aggression towards each other, particularly in smaller tanks. To reduce aggression, it's best to keep one male with
several females. Swordtails are compatible with other peaceful fish like tetras, rasboras, mollies, and Corydoras
catfish. It's advisable to avoid housing them with aggressive or fin-nipping species.

## Breeding

Breeding Swordtail Fish is straightforward, as they are livebearers and will breed readily in a well-maintained
aquarium. Females give birth to live fry approximately every 4-6 weeks, with each brood containing up to 80 fry. To
protect the fry from being eaten by adult fish, provide plenty of hiding spots, such as dense plants or breeding boxes.
The fry can be fed crushed flake food or specialized fry food until they are large enough to eat regular foods.
