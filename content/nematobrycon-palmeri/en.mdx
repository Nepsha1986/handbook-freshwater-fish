## Overview

**Nematobrycon palmeri**, commonly referred to as Palmer's Tetra, is a small, colorful freshwater fish native to the
waters of South America, particularly the Orinoco River basin in Venezuela and Colombia. This species typically grows to
a size of 5-7 cm and has a lifespan of about 3 to 5 years.

Palmer's Tetra is known for its striking coloration, featuring a shimmering blue body with distinct red and yellow
accents. These peaceful fish are ideal for community tanks, as they coexist well with various other species.

## Tank Requirements

**Nematobrycon palmeri** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general hardness
(GH) between 4-10 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-28Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 100 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with plenty of hiding spots and open swimming areas is essential for these fish. They prefer dim
lighting and appreciate driftwood and plants, which mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Nematobrycon palmeri** are omnivorous, feeding on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In
captivity, they accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods such as
brine shrimp and daphnia.

To keep them healthy, it's important to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and plant-based foods.
Feeding should occur once or twice daily, with portions they can consume within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining good water quality is crucial for **Nematobrycon palmeri**. Regular water changes of 20-30% per week are
recommended to keep the water clean and stable. A reliable filtration system is essential to provide a healthy
environment.

These fish prefer well-oxygenated water, so providing adequate aeration through a sponge filter or air stones can be
beneficial. Monitoring water parameters closely will help prevent stress and disease.

## Compatibility

**Nematobrycon palmeri** are peaceful fish that can be kept with various community tankmates. Suitable companions
include tetras, rasboras, and other small, non-aggressive species.

Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish, as they may be bullied or outcompeted for food. Ensuring a spacious
environment with plenty of hiding spots will help reduce stress and aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Nematobrycon palmeri** in captivity can be rewarding but requires some preparation. They are egg layers and
typically spawn among plants in the aquarium.

Setting up a breeding tank with gentle filtration and plenty of plants will encourage spawning behavior. Once the eggs
are laid, they should be removed to prevent them from being eaten by the parents. Fry can be fed infusoria or finely
crushed flakes once they are free-swimming.
