## Overview

The Salvini Cichlid (Cichlasoma salvini) is a striking and vibrant member of the Cichlidae family, native to Central
America, particularly in the rivers of Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. Known for its intense yellow body with black
stripes and red accents, this cichlid can reach a size of 15-20 cm. Salvini Cichlids are known for their aggressive
behavior and are best suited for experienced aquarists who can manage their specific tank needs and territorial nature.

## Tank Requirements

Salvini Cichlids require a spacious tank of at least 250 liters to accommodate their size and territorial behavior. The
ideal water temperature ranges from 24-28°C, with a pH level of 6.5-8.0 and water hardness (GH) between 8-15. These
cichlids thrive in a tank setup that mimics their natural riverine environment, with plenty of rocks, driftwood, and
caves for hiding and establishing territories. A sandy substrate is recommended, and robust filtration is necessary to
maintain water quality. Regular water changes are essential to keep the environment stable and suitable for these active
fish.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Salvini Cichlids are omnivores, feeding on small invertebrates, insects, and plant matter. In captivity,
they should be provided with a balanced diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, along with occasional live or
frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and vegetables. It is important to avoid overfeeding and to ensure a varied
diet to maintain their vibrant coloration and health.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial for the health of Salvini Cichlids. Weekly water changes of 25-30% are recommended to
maintain optimal water conditions. Due to their territorial and aggressive nature, it's important to monitor their
behavior closely to prevent bullying or stress among tank mates. Providing sufficient hiding spots and visual barriers
can help reduce aggression. Keep an eye out for common health issues such as bloat, which can occur if their diet is too
rich or if water quality deteriorates.

## Compatibility

Salvini Cichlids are highly territorial and aggressive, particularly during breeding. They are best kept with other
robust and similarly aggressive cichlids that can hold their own. It's advisable to avoid keeping them with smaller,
more peaceful species, as they may be harassed or injured. Tank mates should be chosen carefully, and the tank should be
large enough to provide ample space for territories.

## Breeding

Breeding Salvini Cichlids can be a challenging but rewarding experience. They are cave spawners, and the female will lay
eggs on a flat surface or inside a cave. To encourage breeding, maintain a slightly higher water temperature around
26-28°C and provide plenty of hiding spots. Both parents will fiercely guard the eggs and fry, displaying increased
aggression during this time. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed with crushed flake food or baby brine
shrimp. It's important to monitor the tank during breeding to prevent excessive aggression towards other tank
inhabitants.
