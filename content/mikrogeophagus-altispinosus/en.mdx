## Overview

The Bolivian Ram (_Mikrogeophagus altispinosus_), a member of the Cichlidae family, is a peaceful and vibrant species
from the river systems of Bolivia and Brazil. With its striking colors and flowing fins, this fish is known for its calm
demeanor, making it a great addition to community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

The Bolivian Ram requires a minimum tank size of 70 liters. Water temperature should be kept between 24-28Â°C, with a pH
of 6.0-7.5. Soft to moderately hard water (GH 5-12) is ideal. The tank should be well-planted with plenty of hiding
places, including rocks and driftwood, to help them feel secure.

## Feeding and Diet

Bolivian Rams are omnivores and should be fed a diet consisting of high-quality pellets, flakes, and occasional live or
frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms. Regularly varied feeding helps maintain their health and enhances their
coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes of around 20-30% per week are recommended to maintain water quality. While they are generally
hardy, Bolivian Rams are sensitive to poor water conditions, so monitoring ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite levels is
crucial.

## Compatibility

Bolivian Rams are peaceful and do well in community tanks with other gentle species such as tetras, dwarf cichlids, and
Corydoras catfish. They prefer calm environments and should not be kept with aggressive or very active tank mates.

## Breeding

Breeding Bolivian Rams can be moderately challenging. They prefer slightly warmer water and a flat surface for
egg-laying. Once the eggs hatch, the parents often guard the fry. Providing ample hiding places and a soft substrate
helps increase breeding success. The fry can be fed with infusoria or other suitable fry foods.
