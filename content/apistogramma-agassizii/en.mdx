## Overview

**Apistogramma agassizii**, commonly referred to as **Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid**, is a small, colorful cichlid species
native to the Amazon Basin in South America. Males display vibrant colors, while females are more subdued but equally
beautiful. This species typically grows between 6-8 cm and is known for its relatively peaceful demeanor, making it a
popular choice for community aquariums. Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid thrives in slow-moving, heavily planted waters.

## Tank Requirements

**Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid** requires a tank of at least 60 liters with a water temperature between 24-28Â°C, pH levels
ranging from 5.0-7.0, and water hardness (GH) of 2-12. A well-planted tank with hiding spots, such as caves or
driftwood, is ideal. Soft, slightly acidic water is preferred for keeping them healthy and comfortable.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Apistogramma agassizii** primarily feeds on small invertebrates and insect larvae. In an aquarium
setting, they can be fed a variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, pellets, and live or frozen foods such
as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. Offering a varied diet helps maintain their vibrant colors and health.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and tank maintenance are essential for keeping **Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid**
healthy. The water should remain clean, and the tank environment should be stable, with minimal fluctuations in water
parameters. Monitoring the water's pH and hardness is particularly important, as this species thrives in soft, acidic
water.

## Compatibility

**Apistogramma agassizii** is generally peaceful, but males may become territorial during breeding. It is best housed
with other peaceful fish species, such as tetras, rasboras, or small catfish. Avoid keeping them with aggressive or
overly active fish, as this can cause stress. Having plenty of hiding spots will help reduce territorial conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding **Apistogramma agassizii** is relatively straightforward. Males and females can be easily distinguished by
their color differences and size, with males being larger and more colorful. To encourage breeding, provide a tank with
soft, acidic water and plenty of hiding spots, such as caves. The female will lay eggs on a surface inside the cave, and
after fertilization, she will guard the eggs and fry. The fry can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp.
