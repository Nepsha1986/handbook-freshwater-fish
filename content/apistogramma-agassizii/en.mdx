## Overview

Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid (_Apistogramma agassizii_) is one of the most popular and recognizable dwarf cichlids from the
family Cichlidae. In the wild, this species inhabits the Amazon basin — slow-moving tributaries, forest streams, and
flooded areas across Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.

Adults reach 6–8 cm, with males being noticeably larger than females. Lifespan is 4–5 years. Male _Apistogramma
agassizii_ display a remarkable variety of color forms: depending on the collection locality, coloration ranges from
brilliant blue to fiery red and yellow. The hallmark feature of this species is the pointed, spade-shaped caudal fin
that resembles a flame tip — earning it the occasional name "flame-tail." Females are smaller, colored in yellowish-grey
tones, and take on a vivid yellow hue when ready to breed.

This species is active during the day and typically occupies the lower and middle water layers, exploring hiding spots
and plants in search of food.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or harem (one male with 2–3 females) of _Apistogramma agassizii_ requires a tank of at least **60 liters**. For a
group with multiple males, a larger aquarium with clearly defined territories is necessary.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 24–28 °C (75–82 °F)
- **pH:** 5.0–7.0
- **Hardness (GH):** 2–12 dGH

This species prefers soft, slightly acidic water — these conditions bring out the most vibrant coloration. Use dark,
sandy substrate. The setup should include plenty of hiding spots: coconut shells, ceramic caves, driftwood, and dense
plant growth (cryptocorynes, echinodorus, Java moss). Each female should have her own cave shelter.

Floating plants create subdued lighting that mimics the shaded forest pools of their natural habitat. Leaf litter
(Indian almond, oak) enriches the water with tannins and gives it a natural yellowish tint.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Apistogramma agassizii_ feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and detritus. In the aquarium, the
fish show a healthy appetite and accept a variety of foods.

Recommended diet:

- **Live and frozen foods:** bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, cyclops, and grindal worms. These are the preferred
  foods that ensure vibrant coloration and breeding readiness.
- **Dry foods:** high-quality cichlid pellets and flakes. Sinking foods are preferable, as apistogrammas like to feed
  near the bottom.

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions. Live and frozen foods should form the core of the diet — feeding only dry foods
causes coloration to fade. Occasional fasting days (once a week) benefit digestion.

## Care and Maintenance

_Apistogramma agassizii_ is an intermediate-level species in terms of care. The key requirement is water parameter
stability. Essential care guidelines:

- **Water changes:** replace 20–25% of the volume weekly with soft, dechlorinated water. Reverse osmosis water with
  remineralization can be used to achieve soft conditions.
- **Filtration:** an efficient filter is necessary, but without strong current. A sponge filter or an external canister
  filter with a spray bar is the optimal choice.
- **Parameter monitoring:** regularly test for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. Apistogrammas are sensitive to
  nitrogenous waste buildup — nitrate levels should not exceed 20 mg/l.
- **Substrate cleaning:** siphon the sandy substrate gently, avoiding areas near shelters with eggs.

This species is sensitive to copper-based medications — keep this in mind when treating diseases in a community tank.

## Compatibility

Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid is a relatively peaceful cichlid, but males can be territorial, especially during breeding. The
best approach is to keep them in a harem: one male to 2–3 females.

Excellent tankmates:

- Small upper-level tetras: [neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [cardinal tetras](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi),
  [black neon tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-herbertaxelrodi), [emperor tetras](/en/nematobrycon-palmeri)
- Small bottom-dwellers: [panda corydoras](/en/corydoras-panda), [pygmy corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus),
  [otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus)
- Pencilfish: [dwarf pencilfish](/en/nannostomus-marginatus)
- Other dwarf cichlids (in spacious tanks): [cockatoo dwarf cichlid](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides),
  [German blue ram](/en/mikrogeophagus-ramirezi)

Avoid pairing with large or aggressive cichlids, active barbs, and fish that compete for bottom-level shelters. Two male
_Apistogramma agassizii_ in a small tank will be in constant conflict.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma agassizii_ is a rewarding experience accessible to hobbyists with basic experience. This species
is a cave spawner — typical behavior for apistogrammas.

**Preparation:**

- Provide each female with her own cave shelter (coconut shell, ceramic cave, or an upturned pot with a small entrance).
- Water parameters to stimulate spawning: temperature 26–27 °C (79–81 °F), pH 5.5–6.5, soft water (GH 2–5).
- Increase feeding with live foods for 1–2 weeks before the expected spawn.

**Spawning and raising fry:**

A female ready to breed turns bright yellow and begins actively inviting the male to her cave. She lays 30–80 eggs on
the ceiling or walls of the cave. After fertilization, the female takes over all egg care, while the male guards the
surrounding territory.

Incubation lasts 3–4 days at 26 °C (79 °F). After another 4–5 days, the fry become free-swimming. The mother leads her
brood around the tank and actively defends it. First food includes baby brine shrimp and microworms. After 2–3 weeks,
the fry transition to larger foods.

Tip: if there are other fish in the tank, the female actually tends to the fry better when she has something to defend
them from — this stimulates her parental instincts.
