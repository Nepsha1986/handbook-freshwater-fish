## Overview

Arnoldichthys spilopterus, also known as the African Red-Eyed Tetra or Arnold's Tetra, is a captivating freshwater
species native to West Africa. With their distinctive red eyes and silver bodies adorned with subtle patterns, these
tetras are a popular choice among aquarists. Growing up to 8-10 cm, they are an active schooling fish that thrive in
groups, making them an excellent addition to community tanks with other peaceful species.

## Tank Requirements

The African Red-Eyed Tetra requires a spacious tank of at least 120 liters to accommodate their active swimming habits.
The water temperature should be maintained between 22-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of 5-12
dGH. A well-planted tank with open areas for swimming and a gentle current will create an ideal environment for these
fish. Regular water changes and efficient filtration are essential to maintain water quality and the health of the fish.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Arnoldichthys spilopterus are omnivores, feeding on small insects, worms, and plant matter. In
an aquarium setting, they should be offered a varied diet that includes high-quality flake food, micro-pellets, and live
or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms. Providing a balanced diet will help maintain their vibrant
coloration and overall health. Feed them 2-3 times daily in small portions.

## Care and Maintenance

Arnoldichthys spilopterus are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for aquarists of all experience levels.
Regular maintenance involves weekly water changes of 25-30%, monitoring water parameters, and keeping the tank clean to
prevent the buildup of harmful substances. Ensure that the tank is securely covered, as these tetras can be active
jumpers. Watch for signs of stress or disease, and take prompt action if any issues are detected.

## Compatibility

The African Red-Eyed Tetra is a peaceful species that gets along well with other non-aggressive fish. Ideal tank mates
include other tetras, rasboras, and small catfish like Corydoras. Avoid keeping them with larger, more aggressive
species that might bully or prey on them. Keeping them in groups of at least six will help reduce stress and encourage
natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Arnoldichthys spilopterus in captivity is possible, though it requires careful preparation. A separate breeding
tank with soft, slightly acidic water (pH around 6.5) and a temperature of 26-28°C is recommended. The tank should be
well-planted, as these fish are egg scatterers. Once spawning occurs, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the
eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-36 hours, and the fry should be fed infusoria or specially prepared fry food
until they are large enough to accept finely crushed flake food.
