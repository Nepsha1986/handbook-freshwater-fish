## Overview

The Yellowfin Xenotilapia (_Xenotilapia flavipinnis_) is a graceful and peaceful cichlid native to Lake Tanganyika in
East Africa. This fish is admired for its yellow-tinted fins and sleek silver body. Known for its shoaling behavior, it
thrives in groups and adds a sense of natural elegance to aquariums. This species requires careful attention to water
quality and tank conditions to replicate its natural habitat.

## Tank Requirements

Yellowfin Xenotilapia requires an aquarium of at least 120 liters to accommodate its shoaling behavior. The ideal water
temperature ranges from 24-28Â°C, with a pH of 7.5-9.0 and water hardness (GH) between 10-20. A sandy substrate is
essential, as this species spends most of its time near the bottom, sifting through the sand. Provide ample open
swimming space along with some rocky areas for hiding and territorial boundaries.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Yellowfin Xenotilapia feeds on small invertebrates and organic matter found in the sand. In captivity, they
thrive on high-quality pellets, flakes, and frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia. Feeding should be
done in small portions multiple times a day to mimic their natural foraging habits.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining stable water conditions is crucial for the health of Yellowfin Xenotilapia. Regular water changes (20-30%
weekly) and efficient filtration are necessary. Monitor water parameters closely, as this species is sensitive to poor
water quality. A calm and consistent environment helps prevent stress and encourages natural behavior.

## Compatibility

Yellowfin Xenotilapia are peaceful and do best when kept in groups of at least six individuals. Suitable tank mates
include other peaceful cichlids and small, non-aggressive fish from Lake Tanganyika. Avoid housing them with larger,
aggressive species, as this can cause stress and disrupt their shoaling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding _Xenotilapia flavipinnis_ in captivity can be challenging. They are biparental mouthbrooders, meaning both
parents take turns holding and protecting the eggs and fry in their mouths. To encourage breeding, provide a calm
environment, sandy substrate, and a diet rich in live and frozen foods. Fry should be fed with finely crushed flakes or
baby brine shrimp after release.
