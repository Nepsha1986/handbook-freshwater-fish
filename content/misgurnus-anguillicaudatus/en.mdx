## Overview

The Weather Loach (_Misgurnus anguillicaudatus_), also known as the Dojo Loach, belongs to the Cobitidae family. It is
native to East Asia and is renowned for its unique behavior of responding to changes in barometric pressure, often
becoming more active before storms. This peaceful, elongated fish can reach up to 25 cm in length and thrives in cooler
water.

## Tank Requirements

Weather Loaches require a tank of at least 100 liters, with a water temperature range of 15-25Â°C. They prefer a slightly
acidic to neutral pH (6.5-8.0) and moderate hardness (GH 5-15). Soft substrate, such as sand, is ideal to allow them to
burrow. Adding hiding spots with plants and decorations will help them feel secure.

## Feeding and Diet

Weather Loaches are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods, including sinking pellets, flakes, and live or frozen
foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp. They also consume detritus and can scavenge for leftovers, helping to keep
the tank clean.

## Care and Maintenance

These fish are hardy and adaptable, requiring moderate maintenance. Regular water changes are important to keep the tank
environment stable. Because they are sensitive to water quality changes, maintaining clean and well-filtered water is
essential for their health.

## Compatibility

Weather Loaches are peaceful and can live harmoniously with other non-aggressive fish of similar size. They enjoy being
kept in small groups and are compatible with fish like tetras, danios, and other loaches. Avoid keeping them with highly
aggressive or very small fish.

## Breeding

Breeding Weather Loaches in captivity is difficult, as they require specific conditions that are challenging to
replicate. They are egg scatterers, and spawning is rare in home aquariums. If spawning does occur, it is best to
separate the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs.
