## Overview

The Climbing Perch (Anabas testudineus) is an amazing representative of the labyrinth fish. Its native range is
Southeast Asia (from India to the Philippines), where it inhabits slow-moving or stagnant bodies of water: swamps,
ponds, ditches, and rice paddies. The main feature of the Anabas is the presence of a special accessory breathing organ
(the labyrinth organ), which allows it to breathe atmospheric air. Thanks to this, it can survive in water with low
oxygen content and even stay out of water for up to several hours. Using the spines on its gill covers and pectoral
fins, the Anabas is able to move on land in search of a new body of water. In nature, it grows up to 25 cm, while in an
aquarium it usually does not exceed 15-20 cm. It is a predatory and hardy fish that will be an interesting subject for
observation.

## Tank Requirements

To keep an Anabas, you will need an aquarium with a volume of at least 150 liters for one individual. The aquarium must
be tightly covered with a lid, as these fish can climb out. It is important to leave an air space between the water
surface and the lid so that the fish has access to atmospheric air. Sand or fine gravel is suitable as a substrate. It
is necessary to create many shelters from driftwood, stones, and caves. It is better to choose hardy plants (Anubias,
Cryptocoryne) and plant them in pots so that the Anabas does not dig them up. Water parameters: temperature 22-30°C, pH
6.0-8.0, hardness 5-20 dGH. Filtration should be effective, but without a strong current.

## Feeding and Diet

The Anabas is a predator. In nature, its diet consists of small fish, insects, worms, and crustaceans. In an aquarium,
it should be fed large live or frozen food: bloodworms, earthworms, shrimp, small fish. It will also eat high-quality
dry food in the form of granules or sticks for predatory fish. Young individuals can be fed daily, adults - 2-3 times a
week. You should not overfeed, as Anabas are prone to obesity.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for an Anabas is not difficult if the right conditions are created. It is important to remember that this is a
hardy, but not immortal, fish. Regular weekly water changes of 25-30% and substrate cleaning will help maintain high
water quality. When handling an Anabas, you should be careful: its gill covers are equipped with sharp spines that can
cause injury. It is not recommended to catch it with a net made of thin fabric, as it can get tangled in it. It is
better to use a plastic container.

## Compatibility

The Anabas is a predator and a loner by nature. Any fish that fits into its mouth will be eaten. Therefore, it can only
be kept with large and strong species that can stand up for themselves. Large cichlids (e.g.,
[Oscars](/en/astronotus-ocellatus)), large catfish (plecos), and other labyrinth fish of a similar size are suitable.
Two male Anabas cannot be kept in the same aquarium due to high intraspecific aggression. It is better to keep one fish
or a pair (male and female) in a very spacious aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding Anabas at home is considered a difficult task, but it is possible. For spawning, a large aquarium (from 200
liters) with a water level of about 20 cm and a large number of floating plants is required. The stimulus for spawning
is abundant feeding with live food and frequent water changes to simulate the rainy season. Unlike many labyrinth fish,
Anabas do not build a bubble nest. The eggs (up to 5000) float on the surface. After spawning, it is better to remove
the parents, as they may eat the eggs. Incubation lasts about 24-48 hours. The starting food for the fry is infusoria,
rotifers, and later - brine shrimp nauplii.
