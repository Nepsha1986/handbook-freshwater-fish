## Overview

**Anabas testudineus**, commonly known as the **Climbing Perch**, is a fascinating freshwater fish native to Southeast
Asia and parts of India. Known for its ability to survive in low-oxygen waters and even "walk" on land using its
pectoral fins, this species is incredibly resilient. **Anabas testudineus** can grow up to 20-25 cm and is an adaptable,
hardy fish, though it can be territorial and predatory towards smaller fish.

## Tank Requirements

**Anabas testudineus** requires a large tank with a minimum volume of 200 liters. The water temperature should be
maintained between 22-30Â°C, with a pH range of 6.0-8.0 and a water hardness (GH) between 6-20. Provide plenty of hiding
spots with rocks, driftwood, and plants. The tank should be covered tightly, as this species can jump or even climb out
of the water.

## Feeding and Diet

**Climbing Perch** are omnivorous, feeding on small fish, insects, crustaceans, and plant matter in the wild. In
captivity, they will readily accept high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, and occasional
vegetable matter. They should be fed a varied diet to ensure proper nutrition. Caution is needed when feeding them
alongside smaller tank mates, as they may prey on them.

## Care and Maintenance

**Anabas testudineus** are hardy fish that can tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including low oxygen levels.
Regular water changes and tank maintenance are essential for keeping them healthy, as they are still prone to common
diseases if the tank is poorly maintained. Keep the water clean and oxygenated with moderate filtration.

## Compatibility

**Climbing Perch** can be territorial and predatory, especially towards smaller tank mates. They are best kept with
similarly sized, robust fish that can hold their own. Good tank mates include larger cichlids, gouramis, and other tough
species. Avoid keeping them with small or timid fish, as they may become prey.

## Breeding

Breeding **Anabas testudineus** in captivity is challenging. They are egg scatterers, and successful breeding usually
requires large tanks with plenty of hiding places. Recreating rainy season conditions with temperature changes and
increased water flow may help trigger spawning. However, this species does not typically breed easily in home aquariums.
