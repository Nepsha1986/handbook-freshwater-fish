## Overview

**Hyphessobrycon bentosi**, commonly known as the _Bentosi Tetra_ or _Ornate Tetra_, is a peaceful and vibrant fish that
adds elegance to any aquarium. Its striking colors and flowing fins make it a favorite among aquarists. Native to the
Amazon Basin, this species thrives in well-planted aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Bentosi Tetras do well in tanks of at least 70 liters. Maintain water temperatures between 22–28°C, a pH of 6.0–7.5, and
a general hardness of 3–10 dGH. The tank should be decorated with plants, driftwood, and subdued lighting to replicate
their natural habitat. They enjoy open swimming spaces and feel more comfortable in a group of at least 6.

## Feeding and Diet

Bentosi Tetras are omnivores and readily accept a variety of foods. A balanced diet of high-quality flakes or pellets,
along with occasional live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms, will keep them healthy. They
may also enjoy finely chopped vegetables like spinach or zucchini.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is hardy and easy to care for, making it suitable for beginners. Perform regular water changes and ensure
good filtration to maintain water quality. Their peaceful nature allows them to coexist with a variety of tankmates,
provided they are non-aggressive.

## Compatibility

Bentosi Tetras are peaceful schooling fish that thrive in groups of their own kind. They are compatible with other
small, non-aggressive species such as other tetras, rasboras, or small corydoras catfish. Avoid keeping them with larger
or aggressive species, as they may feel stressed.

## Breeding

Breeding Bentosi Tetras requires a separate breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water. Use fine-leafed plants or a
spawning mop to provide a surface for egg-laying. Condition the adults with live or frozen foods to encourage spawning.
After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The fry will hatch in 24–36 hours and can be fed
infusoria or liquid fry food until they grow large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
