## Overview

Corydoras sterbai, commonly referred to as Sterba's Cory, is a small, peaceful catfish species that originates from the
river systems of Brazil and Bolivia. Recognized for their striking white spots on a dark background, Sterbai Corys are a
popular choice for community tanks. These catfish typically grow to about 6-7 cm in length and are known for their
shoaling behavior, often seen swimming in groups at the bottom of the tank. Their friendly and active nature makes them
a great addition to any peaceful aquarium setup.

## Tank Requirements

Sterba's Corys thrive in well-maintained freshwater tanks with a minimum volume of 80 liters. The water temperature
should be kept between 24-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.8 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-15. These fish prefer a
soft, sandy substrate to protect their delicate barbels, and the tank should be planted with plenty of hiding spots such
as driftwood and rocks. Corydoras sterbai are sensitive to poor water conditions, so regular water changes and efficient
filtration are essential to maintain their health.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Sterba's Corys feed on small insects, worms, and plant matter. In captivity, they should be
provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality sinking pellets, frozen or live foods like bloodworms and brine
shrimp, and occasional vegetable matter. Feeding should be done 1-2 times daily, ensuring that the food reaches the
bottom of the tank where these bottom dwellers can access it.

## Care and Maintenance

Corydoras sterbai are relatively easy to care for, provided their water quality is kept in check. Weekly water changes
of 20-30% are recommended to maintain optimal water conditions. These fish are social creatures and should be kept in
groups of at least 5-6 to promote natural behavior and reduce stress. Regularly monitor their barbels for signs of wear
or infection, as this can indicate poor substrate conditions. They are generally hardy but can be susceptible to
diseases like Ich, so early detection and treatment are important.

## Compatibility

Sterba's Corys are peaceful and can be housed with a variety of tank mates, including other small, non-aggressive
species. Ideal companions include tetras, rasboras, guppies, and other peaceful catfish. Avoid keeping them with large
or aggressive fish that may see them as prey. Due to their social nature, they do best in community tanks with other
peaceful fish and should not be kept alone.

## Breeding

Breeding Corydoras sterbai in captivity is achievable with the right conditions. To encourage breeding, provide a
well-maintained tank with soft water and a slightly lower temperature of around 24-26°C. The fish will usually spawn
after a significant water change that simulates the rainy season. The female will lay eggs on flat surfaces, such as the
aquarium glass or broad-leafed plants. After spawning, the parents should be removed to prevent them from eating the
eggs. The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are
large enough to eat regular foods.
