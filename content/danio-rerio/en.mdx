## Overview

The Zebra Danio (_Danio rerio_), also known as the Zebrafish or Striped Danio, is a popular freshwater fish from the
_Danionidae_ family. Recognized by its slender, torpedo-shaped body, it features striking blue-purple horizontal stripes
against a silvery-gold background, running from gills to tail. Native to the tropical and subtropical waters of South
Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, these fish inhabit slow-moving streams, rivers, and ponds. They
are highly active, shoaling fish that typically reach an adult size of 4-6 cm.

## Tank Requirements

Zebra Danios are hardy and adaptable, suitable for various aquarium conditions. A minimum tank size of 38 liters (10
gallons) is recommended for a small school, though a 75-liter (20-gallon) tank is preferable to accommodate their active
swimming. They thrive in water temperatures from 18-25°C (64-77°F), a pH between 6.0-8.0, and a general hardness (GH) of
5-19 dGH.

The tank should offer ample open swimming space, especially in the upper and middle levels. Incorporate live plants like
Java moss and other decorations around the periphery to provide hiding spots. A darker substrate can help showcase their
vibrant colors. Good filtration with a gentle flow is appreciated. A secure lid is essential, as Zebra Daniios are known
to jump.

## Feeding and Diet

Zebra Danios are omnivores and are not fussy eaters. In the wild, their diet consists of small crustaceans, insects, and
algae. In an aquarium, a balanced diet of high-quality flake food or small pellets should be their staple. Supplement
this with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, bloodworms, and tubifex worms to ensure complete
nutrition. You can also offer fresh vegetables like spinach. Feed them small amounts once or twice a day, providing only
what they can consume within 2 minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Zebra Danios are easy to care for, making them an excellent choice for beginners. Regular maintenance is key to their
health. Perform weekly water changes of 10-25% to maintain good water quality. While generally robust, poor water
conditions can lead to stress and common diseases like ich and fin rot. A clean, stable environment and a balanced diet
will help them live a full lifespan, which can be up to 5 years.

## Compatibility

Zebra Danios are peaceful, social fish that must be kept in schools of at least 6-10 individuals. Smaller groups can
lead to stress and fin-nipping. They are compatible with other active, peaceful, similarly-sized fish like other Danios,
Barbs, Corydoras Catfish, and Tetras. Avoid housing them with slow-moving or long-finned fish such as Angelfish, Bettas,
or Guppies, as they may nip their fins. They can also act as "dither fish," helping to calm more timid species in the
tank.

## Breeding

Zebra Danios are prolific and one of the easiest egg-laying species to breed. A separate breeding tank is recommended to
protect the eggs from being eaten. Use a shallow tank (around 15 cm deep) with a coarse substrate like marbles or a
breeding net to allow eggs to fall through safely. Add fine-leafed plants like Java moss.

Introduce a conditioned group of one or two females and two to four males. Spawning typically occurs in the morning.
Remove the adults after spawning. The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days. Feed the fry tiny foods like infusoria or powdered
fry food, transitioning to baby brine shrimp after about two weeks.
