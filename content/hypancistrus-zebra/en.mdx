## Overview

The Zebra Pleco (_Hypancistrus zebra_), also known as L046, is a visually striking species from the Loricariidae family.
It is native to the fast-flowing, oxygen-rich waters of the Xingu River in Brazil. Known for its bold black-and-white
striped pattern, this peaceful fish has gained popularity among aquarists but requires specific care due to its
sensitivity to water conditions.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 80 liters is suitable for the Zebra Pleco, though larger is always better, especially if housing
multiple fish. Ideal water conditions include a temperature range of 26-30Â°C, pH levels between 6.0 and 7.5, and a GH of
5-10. Zebra Plecos prefer tanks with plenty of hiding spots, such as driftwood and caves, to replicate their natural
habitat. Strong water flow and high oxygen levels are essential to keep them comfortable.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Zebra Plecos are omnivorous, consuming biofilm, algae, and small invertebrates. In the aquarium, they enjoy
a varied diet of sinking pellets, algae wafers, and occasional treats of bloodworms and brine shrimp. Avoid high-protein
diets as a staple; instead, offer a balanced mix of plant-based and protein-rich foods.

## Care and Maintenance

Zebra Plecos require pristine water conditions, making regular maintenance and water changes essential. Weekly water
changes of 20-30% are recommended, along with monitoring water parameters closely. A strong filtration system and good
water aeration are key to keeping Zebra Plecos healthy and stress-free.

## Compatibility

Zebra Plecos are generally peaceful and can coexist with other calm, small fish that share similar water requirements.
Avoid aggressive or overly active tank mates, as Zebra Plecos are shy and prefer a calm environment. Tank mates like
small tetras and corydoras catfish are suitable companions.

## Breeding

Breeding Zebra Plecos in captivity is challenging due to their specific water requirements and territorial nature during
spawning. They typically lay eggs in secluded caves, and the male guards the eggs until they hatch. To encourage
breeding, provide plenty of cave-like hiding spots and slightly increase the water temperature.
