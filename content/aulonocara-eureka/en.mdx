## Overview

The Eureka Peacock Cichlid (_Aulonocara eureka_), also known as the Red Peacock Cichlid, is a popular choice among
aquarists due to its stunning coloration and unique, shimmering pattern. Native to Lake Malawi in Africa, this species
is generally peaceful for a cichlid but may display territorial behavior, especially during breeding. Their captivating
appearance and manageable care needs make them ideal for intermediate aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Eureka Peacocks thrive in a spacious aquarium of at least 200 liters. They require warm water temperatures between
24-28Â°C, a pH range of 7.5-8.5, and moderate to hard water (GH 10-20). A sandy substrate, combined with rocks or caves,
provides an ideal setup that mimics their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes help maintain high
water quality, which is essential for their health and vibrant colors.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Eureka Peacocks primarily feed on small invertebrates and plankton. In an aquarium, they do well with a
varied diet of high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia.
Avoid overfeeding and maintain a balanced diet to ensure their vibrant coloration and optimal health.

## Care and Maintenance

Although moderately hardy, Eureka Peacocks require consistent water conditions. Weekly water changes of around 20-30%
and regular tank cleaning are recommended to prevent the buildup of harmful waste. Monitor for common cichlid diseases,
such as Malawi bloat, which can occur due to poor water quality or an improper diet.

## Compatibility

Eureka Peacocks are relatively peaceful for a cichlid but can be territorial, particularly males during breeding. They
are best housed with other peaceful to moderately aggressive African cichlids of similar size. Avoid keeping them with
smaller, delicate fish or overly aggressive tank mates, as this can lead to stress and territorial conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara eureka_ is possible in an aquarium setting. They are mouthbrooders, with females carrying the
fertilized eggs in their mouths until the fry hatch. To encourage breeding, provide stable water conditions, a
nutritious diet, and ample hiding spaces. After spawning, consider using a separate tank for the fry, as other fish may
prey on them.
