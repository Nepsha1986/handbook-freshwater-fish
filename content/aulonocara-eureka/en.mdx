## Overview

_Aulonocara eureka_ is a selectively bred form of peacock cichlids from Lake Malawi, developed from _Aulonocara
jacobfreibergi_. It is one of the most striking Aulonocara varieties: males display a vivid red or orange-red body
contrasting dramatically with a metallic blue head and gill covers. Females, as with all Aulonocara, are plainly colored
in grayish-brown tones.

The fish grows to 10–12 cm and lives 5–10 years. Males reach their full coloration at 8–12 months, and the colors only
intensify with age. _Aulonocara eureka_ belongs to the group commonly known as "peacocks" — cichlids of the genus
Aulonocara, renowned for their extraordinary range of bright colorations.

Like all Aulonocara, the Eureka possesses a unique system of sensory pores on the lower jaw that allows it to detect the
slightest movements of invertebrates in sand. In the aquarium, you can observe this characteristic behavior: the fish
hovers motionlessly above the substrate, then strikes with a sudden lunge to capture prey.

## Tank Requirements

Keeping a group of _Aulonocara eureka_ requires an aquarium of at least 200 liters. Optimal water parameters are typical
for Malawi cichlids: temperature 24–28 °C, pH 7.5–8.5, and general hardness GH 10–20. These parameters replicate the
alkaline environment of Lake Malawi.

The substrate must be sand. Aulonocara hunt by sifting sand through their gills, and coarse substrate can damage their
sensitive sensory pores. The layout should feature rock formations with caves and crevices that create territories and
shelters. Place rocks along the sides and back wall, leaving an open sandy area in the center.

Live plants are rarely used in Malawi setups due to the alkaline water, though tough-leaved species (Anubias,
Vallisneria) can survive. Lighting should be moderate to bright to showcase the fish's coloration.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Aulonocara are micro-predators that feed on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and zooplankton extracted
from the sandy bottom. In the aquarium, _Aulonocara eureka_ is not fussy about food, but a balanced diet is critically
important.

The staple diet should consist of quality cichlid pellets enriched with carotenoids to enhance coloration. Regularly
supplement with frozen foods: brine shrimp, bloodworms, cyclops, and mysis shrimp. Live foods are an excellent treat but
should be offered cautiously due to the risk of introducing infections.

Feed twice daily in small portions. Strictly avoid overfeeding — Malawi cichlids are prone to abdominal bloating (Malawi
bloat), which is often linked to improper nutrition. Do not offer foods high in mammalian fats and proteins (beef heart,
large amounts of tubifex).

## Care and Maintenance

_Aulonocara eureka_ is a moderately demanding cichlid (care level 3 out of 5), suitable for aquarists with some
cichlid-keeping experience. Stable water parameters are the key to health and vibrant coloration.

Weekly water changes of 25–30% are essential. Filtration should be powerful — an external canister filter is preferred.
Monitor nitrate levels: they should not exceed 20 mg/l, as Malawi cichlids are particularly sensitive to elevated
nitrates.

The main health risk is Malawi bloat, which manifests as abdominal swelling, loss of appetite, and lethargy. Prevention
includes quality varied nutrition, clean water, and the absence of chronic stress from aggressive tankmates.

## Compatibility

_Aulonocara eureka_ is one of the more peaceful Malawi cichlids (behavior rated 3 out of 5), but males become
territorial, especially during spawning. It is best to keep one male with 2–3 females.

Excellent tankmates include other Aulonocara: [Aulonocara jacobfreibergi](/en/aulonocara-jacobfreibergi),
[Aulonocara nyassae](/en/aulonocara-nyassae), as well as peaceful Malawi species such as
[Labidochromis](/en/labidochromis-caeruleus), [Copadichromis](/en/copadichromis-borleyi), and
[Protomelas](/en/protomelas-taeniolatus). Cohabitation with [Iodotropheus](/en/iodotropheus-sprengerae) is also
acceptable.

Do not keep with aggressive mbuna: [Pseudotropheus](/en/pseudotropheus-zebra) and [Maylandia](/en/maylandia-lombardoi)
will harass and stress the calmer Aulonocara. Also avoid housing males of different Aulonocara species with similar
coloration — this provokes heightened aggression. Small fish (tetras, rasboras) will become prey.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara eureka_ is not particularly difficult (rated 3 out of 5) and is achievable in a home aquarium. Like
all Aulonocara, they are maternal mouthbrooders: the female carries the fertilized eggs in her mouth for 18–21 days.

For spawning, the male claims a territory — usually a flat rock or a cleared patch of sand — and displays his vibrant
colors to attract a female. After the eggs are laid, the female collects them in her mouth, and fertilization occurs via
the "egg spot" method — false egg markings on the male's anal fin.

The brooding female refuses food for the entire incubation period and loses noticeable weight. In a community tank, fry
should not be released — they will be eaten by tankmates. It is recommended to carefully move the female to a separate
30–40 liter tank a few days before the fry are released. From the first day, fry accept baby brine shrimp and finely
crushed pellets. A typical clutch contains 15–30 fry.
