## Overview

**Stigmatogobius sadanundio**, commonly known as the Knight Goby, belongs to the Gobiidae family and is native to the
brackish and freshwater environments of Southeast Asia. This species is characterized by its pale body covered in dark
spots, giving it a distinctive look.

They grow to a size of 7-10 cm and have a lifespan of about 3-5 years when kept in optimal conditions. While generally
peaceful, Knight Gobies can become territorial, especially when competing for food or space.

## Tank Requirements

Knight Gobies prefer temperatures between 22-28Â°C, with a pH of 7.0-8.5 and hardness (GH) of 8-15. A minimum tank size
of 60 liters is recommended, and they thrive in slightly brackish conditions. A well-decorated tank with plenty of
hiding places like rocks, driftwood, and plants will help them feel secure and reduce territorial aggression.

Because of their semi-aggressive nature, it's crucial to provide adequate space for each goby to establish its
territory.

## Feeding and Diet

Knight Gobies are omnivores, feeding on small invertebrates, insects, and plant matter in their natural habitat. In an
aquarium, they can be fed live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small crustaceans, along with
high-quality pellets or flakes.

It's essential to maintain a varied diet to ensure they receive the necessary nutrients.

## Care and Maintenance

While **Stigmatogobius sadanundio** is generally easy to care for, they do require stable water conditions and regular
maintenance. Since they prefer brackish water, adding a small amount of marine salt can help replicate their natural
environment.

Water quality should be monitored closely to prevent stress or illness, and regular water changes are necessary to
maintain optimal conditions.

## Compatibility

Although **Knight Gobies** can coexist with other peaceful fish, they may become territorial, especially toward their
own kind. Therefore, it's important to provide enough hiding spots to minimize conflicts. They are best kept with other
brackish water fish or peaceful species that can tolerate similar water parameters.

Avoid housing them with aggressive or very small tank mates, as they may see them as competition or prey.

## Breeding

Breeding **Stigmatogobius sadanundio** in captivity is rare but possible under the right conditions. They are cave
spawners, with the male guarding the eggs until they hatch. If breeding is successful, it is important to provide
separate hiding areas to reduce aggression.

Raising the fry can be challenging, as they require very fine live foods, such as infusoria or newly hatched brine
shrimp.
