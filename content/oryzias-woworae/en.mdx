## Overview

Daisy's Ricefish (_Oryzias woworae_) is a small, vibrant freshwater fish native to Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Its
body is adorned with iridescent blue and red hues, making it a visually striking choice for nano aquariums. Known for
their peaceful nature and relatively simple care requirements, these fish are well-suited for both beginners and
experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Daisy's Ricefish can thrive in small tanks with a minimum size of 20 liters, with water temperatures between 24-28Â°C and
a pH of 6.5-7.5. They prefer moderately soft to slightly hard water with a GH range of 5-15. A densely planted tank with
gentle filtration and low flow suits them best, as it provides hiding spots and resembles their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Daisy's Ricefish feed on small insects and plankton. In the aquarium, they do well with a
varied diet that includes high-quality flakes, micro pellets, and occasional live or frozen foods like daphnia or baby
brine shrimp. A varied diet helps maintain their vivid colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care involves weekly water changes of around 25-30% and monitoring water parameters to ensure stability. They
are sensitive to fluctuations, so keeping conditions stable is essential. As they are small, peaceful fish, they do well
in community tanks with other non-aggressive species.

## Compatibility

Daisy's Ricefish are peaceful and social, making them ideal for nano community tanks. Suitable tank mates include small
tetras, rasboras, and other gentle fish. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species, as they can be easily
intimidated or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding Daisy's Ricefish is relatively easy. Males and females can be distinguished by their size and fin shape, with
males typically being more colorful and slender. When ready to breed, females will carry eggs near their anal fins
before scattering them among plants. A breeding setup with fine-leaved plants or spawning mops can help maximize fry
survival, as adults may eat the eggs if left unprotected.
