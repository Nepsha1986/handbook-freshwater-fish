## Overview

The Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid (Apistogramma cacatuoides) is a small, strikingly colorful species from the Cichlidae family,
native to the slow-moving waters of the Amazon Basin. This species, named after its unique, elongated dorsal fin that
resembles a cockatoo's crest, is popular in the aquarium hobby due to its vibrant colors and interesting behavior.
Typically reaching 6-8 cm in length, these cichlids display vivid hues of orange, red, and blue, especially in males.
They are relatively peaceful compared to other cichlids, making them suitable for community tanks with compatible
species.

## Tank Requirements

Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids thrive in well-planted aquariums with plenty of hiding spots and soft, sandy substrates. A tank
of at least 70 liters is recommended, with water temperatures maintained between 24-28Â°C. The water should be slightly
acidic to neutral, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-12. They appreciate subdued lighting and
areas of dense vegetation, where they can establish territories. Driftwood and caves are also beneficial, as these
provide additional hiding places and breeding sites.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids are omnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant matter. In
captivity, they should be offered a varied diet consisting of high-quality flake foods, micro pellets, and frozen or
live foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. Feeding should be done once or twice daily, ensuring that all
food is consumed within a few minutes. A diverse diet helps maintain their vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Apistogramma cacatuoides are relatively easy to care for, but they do require stable water conditions. Regular water
changes of 20-30% weekly are important to maintain optimal water quality. Monitor water parameters closely, as these
cichlids are sensitive to poor conditions. They are prone to common cichlid diseases, such as ich and fin rot, so it's
essential to observe them regularly for any signs of illness. Providing a stress-free environment with plenty of hiding
spots and a proper diet will help keep them healthy.

## Compatibility

Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids are generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They do well in
community tanks with other small, peaceful species, such as tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid keeping them with
larger or more aggressive species that may bully them. It's recommended to keep them in pairs or small harems, with one
male and several females, to minimize aggression. Ensure there are plenty of hiding spots to reduce territorial
disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlids is relatively straightforward. They are cave spawners, with females typically laying
eggs in small, enclosed spaces such as caves or under driftwood. Once the eggs are laid, the female will guard the nest
while the male patrols the territory. The eggs hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry become free-swimming within a week.
The fry can be fed infusoria or commercially prepared fry foods initially, followed by finely crushed flakes or micro
worms as they grow. It's important to maintain excellent water quality during the breeding process to ensure the health
of the fry.
