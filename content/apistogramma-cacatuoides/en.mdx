## Overview

_Apistogramma cacatuoides_ is one of the most popular and recognizable dwarf cichlids in the Cichlidae family. In the
wild, this species inhabits slow-moving waters of the Amazon basin — in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, where they live
among submerged leaf litter and roots of riparian trees.

The species gets its "Cockatoo" name from the male's distinctive elongated dorsal fin rays that resemble a cockatoo's
crest. Adults reach 6–8 cm in length and live for 5–7 years with proper care. Sexual dimorphism is pronounced: males are
significantly larger and more colorful, with fins adorned in vivid orange, red, and blue hues. Females are smaller and
more modestly colored, but develop an intense yellow coloration during spawning.

Compared to the calmer [Borelli's Dwarf Cichlid](/en/apistogramma-borellii), _A. cacatuoides_ has a more assertive
personality and greater territoriality, yet remains peaceful enough for a community aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or harem of _Apistogramma cacatuoides_ (one male and 2–3 females) requires a tank of at least **70 liters**. For
a community setup with other species, a 100-liter or larger tank is preferable.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 24–28 °C
- **pH:** 6.0–7.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 5–12

One of the key advantages of this species is its adaptability to a wide range of water parameters, making it an
excellent choice for beginners venturing into the world of apistogrammas.

The aquarium should be furnished with plenty of hiding spots: driftwood, coconut shells, ceramic tubes, and scattered
rocks will provide the necessary structure. Each female should have her own cave-like shelter. A soft sandy substrate is
preferred — these fish enjoy sifting through it in search of food. Live plants — cryptocorynes, anubias, Java moss —
create natural territorial boundaries and help the fish feel secure.

Lighting should be subdued or diffused through floating plants. Water flow should be gentle.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apistogramma cacatuoides_ is an omnivorous species with a strong preference for live foods. In the wild, they feed on
small crustaceans, insect larvae, and detritus.

In the aquarium, the base diet consists of high-quality cichlid pellets or flakes, but to maintain health, vibrant
coloration, and stimulate breeding, it is important to regularly offer live and frozen foods:

- **Brine shrimp** — a versatile staple live food
- **Bloodworms** — a nutritious treat, offer 2–3 times per week
- **Daphnia** — beneficial for digestion, especially helpful for preventing bloat
- **Cyclops and glassworms** — excellent dietary supplements

Feed twice a day in small portions. _A. cacatuoides_ are active hunters: they eagerly pick food off the bottom and even
catch live prey in the water column. Make sure food reaches their level and isn't intercepted by faster-swimming
tankmates.

## Care and Maintenance

The care level for _A. cacatuoides_ is moderate. These fish are fairly hardy, but like all apistogrammas, they are
sensitive to water quality.

Key recommendations:

- **Water changes:** 20–30% weekly, using water with matching parameters
- **Filtration:** moderate, without strong current — a sponge filter or canister filter with a spray bar works well
- **Substrate:** regularly vacuum the sandy bottom, removing uneaten food and waste
- **Observation:** watch the condition of their fins — frayed edges may indicate bacterial infection or aggression

A healthy _A. cacatuoides_ is active, vibrantly colored, and regularly patrols its territory. Fading colors, loss of
appetite, or constant hiding are signs of stress or the onset of illness. At the first symptoms, check water parameters
and assess the tank dynamics.

## Compatibility

_Apistogramma cacatuoides_ is a moderately territorial species, especially during breeding. Nevertheless, it is
well-suited for a community tank when tankmates are chosen carefully.

Ideal companions are small, schooling fish that occupy the upper and middle water layers:

- [Neon Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-innesi) and [Cardinal Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi) — a classic pairing with
  apistogrammas
- [Ember Tetra](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae) — a peaceful nano tetra that won't compete for territory
- [Chili Rasbora](/en/rasbora-brigittae) — a calm upper-level swimmer
- [Sterbai Corydoras](/en/corydoras-sterbai) and [Panda Corydoras](/en/corydoras-panda) — peaceful bottom dwellers
- [Otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus) — a useful algae eater

Avoid large, aggressive fish and other apistogramma species in the same tank — territorial conflicts will be inevitable.
The optimal arrangement is one male with 2–3 females. Two males in a tank under 150 liters will constantly clash.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma cacatuoides_ is a rewarding process, accessible to aquarists with moderate experience. This
species is a cave spawner, and under suitable conditions, they breed readily.

To stimulate spawning, maintain the temperature at 26–28 °C, slightly reduce water hardness, and provide each female
with a separate shelter — a coconut shell, ceramic tube, or small rock cave. The female selects her preferred shelter,
thoroughly cleans it, and deposits 50–100 eggs on the cave ceiling, after which she develops a vivid yellow coloration.

After spawning, the female assumes full responsibility for the clutch: she fans the eggs, removes dead ones, and
aggressively defends the nest from everyone, including the male. During this period, the female can be very aggressive —
ensure the male and other fish have space to retreat.

The larvae hatch in 2–3 days, and the fry become free-swimming around day 5–7. First foods should include artemia
nauplii and microworms. The female continues to guard and lead her school of fry around the tank for several weeks.
Watching the maternal care of _A. cacatuoides_ is a true delight for any aquarist.
