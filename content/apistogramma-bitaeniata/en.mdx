## Overview

The Two-Stripe Dwarf Cichlid (_Apistogramma bitaeniata_) is one of the most elegant members of the genus Apistogramma
from the family Cichlidae. This species inhabits shallow forest streams and flooded areas of the Amazon basin across
Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, favoring stretches of dark, tannin-rich water.

Adults reach 5–7 cm, with a lifespan of 5–7 years. Male _Apistogramma bitaeniata_ are among the most beautiful in the
genus: the elongated body features two dark horizontal stripes, and the dorsal fin is notably tall and pointed.
Coloration varies by collection locality — from bluish-silver to bright yellow with blue highlights. Females are smaller
and more subdued in color but develop a vivid yellow hue with contrasting black markings when ready to spawn.

This species is active during the day and occupies the lower and middle water layers. The Two-Stripe Dwarf Cichlid is a
true gem for aquarists who appreciate natural beauty and fascinating fish behavior.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or harem (one male with 2–3 females) of _Apistogramma bitaeniata_ can be kept in a tank of at least **50
liters**. This species requires a well-thought-out setup with plenty of hiding spots.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 24–28 °C (75–82 °F)
- **pH:** 5.0–7.0
- **Hardness (GH):** 1–10 dGH

_Apistogramma bitaeniata_ thrives best in soft, acidic water — under these conditions the coloration reaches its full
potential. Use dark, sandy substrate. Caves and shelters are essential: coconut shells, ceramic caves, and driftwood.
Each female needs her own cave. Dense vegetation (cryptocorynes, Java moss, echinodorus) and floating plants create
subdued lighting that mimics shaded forest pools.

Leaf litter (Indian almond, oak) is an important part of the setup. It enriches the water with tannins, lowers pH, and
creates an environment close to the species' natural habitat. Current should be minimal — in the wild, these fish
inhabit nearly still waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Apistogramma bitaeniata_ feeds on small invertebrates, microcrustaceans, and insect larvae. In the
aquarium, these fish prefer live and frozen food over dry options.

Recommended diet:

- **Live and frozen foods:** bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, cyclops, and grindal worms. These form the core of the
  diet, directly impacting health and color vibrancy.
- **Dry foods:** high-quality sinking pellets or flakes for dwarf cichlids can be offered as a supplement but should not
  be the primary diet.

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions that the fish consume within 2–3 minutes. Two-Stripe Dwarf Cichlids are
deliberate feeders that pick food off the bottom, so it is important that food reaches them before being eaten by
tankmates in the upper layers.

## Care and Maintenance

_Apistogramma bitaeniata_ is an intermediate-level species. The primary requirement is stable water parameters and
cleanliness. Key guidelines:

- **Water changes:** replace 20–25% of the volume weekly with soft, dechlorinated or RO water. Perform changes in
  smaller increments to avoid sudden parameter swings.
- **Filtration:** a sponge filter or external canister filter with a spray bar. Strong current is unacceptable.
- **Parameter monitoring:** regularly test for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. This species is very sensitive to
  organic pollution — nitrate levels should remain below 15–20 mg/l.
- **Substrate cleaning:** gently siphon the sand, avoiding areas near caves where eggs may be present.

Two-Stripe Dwarf Cichlids are susceptible to bacterial infections when water quality deteriorates. Prevention is the
best cure: clean water and stable parameters prevent most diseases.

## Compatibility

The Two-Stripe Dwarf Cichlid is a peaceful cichlid, but males become territorial during breeding. The optimal approach
is to keep them in a harem: one male with 2–3 females.

Excellent tankmates:

- Small upper-level tetras: [neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [cardinal tetras](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi),
  [black neon tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-herbertaxelrodi), [ember tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae)
- Dwarf corydoras: [pygmy corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus), [panda corydoras](/en/corydoras-panda)
- Surface-dwelling fish: [marbled hatchetfish](/en/carnegiella-strigata)
- Pencilfish: [dwarf pencilfish](/en/nannostomus-marginatus)
- [Otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus)

Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, with other Apistogramma species in a small tank, or with active barbs
that may nip the males' elongated fins. Two male _Apistogramma bitaeniata_ will conflict if territory is insufficient —
in tanks under 80 liters, it is best to keep only one male.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma bitaeniata_ is accessible to hobbyists with basic experience keeping dwarf cichlids. This species
is a cave spawner with pronounced parental care.

**Preparation:**

- Provide each female with her own cave (coconut shell, ceramic cave with a narrow entrance).
- Water parameters for spawning: temperature 26–27 °C (79–81 °F), pH 5.0–6.0, very soft water (GH 1–4). Acidic and soft
  water is the key condition for successful breeding of this species.
- Increase feeding with live foods for 1–2 weeks before the expected spawn.

**Spawning and raising fry:**

A female ready to breed turns a rich yellow and actively entices the male toward her cave. The clutch typically consists
of 40–80 eggs attached to the ceiling or walls of the cave. After fertilization, the female takes over all egg care,
fanning them with her fins and removing unfertilized eggs.

Incubation lasts 3–4 days at 26 °C (79 °F). About 5–6 days after hatching, the fry become free-swimming and the mother
leads them out of the cave. She actively defends the brood, escorting them around the tank. First food includes baby
brine shrimp and microworms. By 3–4 weeks, the fry begin accepting larger foods.

Tip: for maximum fry survival, it is best to remove the male after spawning — the female can manage guarding duties on
her own, and the male can occasionally pose a threat to the offspring.
