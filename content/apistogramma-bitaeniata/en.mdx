## Overview

**Apistogramma bitaeniata**, commonly known as the **Two-striped Dwarf Cichlid**, is a strikingly beautiful species
found in the Amazon Basin. Its slender body is decorated with two horizontal stripes, and the males display vibrant
colors. This species typically grows to 5-7 cm and has a lifespan of 5-7 years. It is a peaceful species that thrives in
densely planted tanks with soft, slightly acidic water.

## Tank Requirements

The **Two-striped Dwarf Cichlid** requires an aquarium of at least 50 liters. The water temperature should be maintained
between 24-28Â°C with a pH level of 5.0-7.0, and the water hardness (GH) should be between 1-10. A well-planted tank with
hiding spots, caves, and a soft substrate is ideal for this species. Dim lighting is recommended to mimic their natural
environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Apistogramma bitaeniata** feeds on small invertebrates. In captivity, they can be fed a variety of live
or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. They may also accept high-quality cichlid pellets.
Feeding them 2-3 times a day with small portions is recommended to prevent overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes are important to maintain water quality for the **Two-striped Dwarf Cichlid**. Weekly water
changes of about 25% are ideal. The tank should be kept clean, with stable water parameters, as this species is
sensitive to fluctuations. Monitoring water chemistry and providing a peaceful environment are key to their well-being.

## Compatibility

**Apistogramma bitaeniata** is generally peaceful and can be kept in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive
fish. Ideal tank mates include tetras, small rasboras, and peaceful dwarf cichlids. Avoid keeping them with large or
aggressive fish, as they can become stressed.

## Breeding

Breeding **Apistogramma bitaeniata** is possible in captivity. They are cave spawners, and females will lay eggs in a
secure cave or hiding spot. To encourage breeding, maintain soft, acidic water and offer a variety of high-quality live
foods. Once the eggs are laid, the female guards the nest, while the male may protect the territory. The fry can be fed
infusoria or other fine fry food once they are free-swimming.
