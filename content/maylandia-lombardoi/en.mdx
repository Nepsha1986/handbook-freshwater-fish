## Overview

**Maylandia lombardoi**, also known as _Pseudotropheus lombardoi_ or the Kenyi Cichlid, is a bold and beautiful cichlid
species endemic to Lake Malawi. Known for its striking sexual dimorphism, males exhibit bright yellow coloration, while
females and juveniles are a vibrant blue with black vertical bars.

## Tank Requirements

Maylandia lombardoi requires a spacious aquarium of at least 200 liters to accommodate its territorial and active
nature. A setup with plenty of rocks and caves provides essential hiding spots and mimics its natural habitat. Maintain
water parameters between 24-28Â°C, pH of 7.8-8.6, and hardness of 10-20 dGH.

## Feeding and Diet

These cichlids are omnivores, thriving on a varied diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, spirulina-based foods, and
occasional treats of live or frozen brine shrimp or bloodworms. Avoid overfeeding protein-rich foods, as it can lead to
health issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Kenyi Cichlids are relatively hardy but require consistent water quality and regular maintenance. Frequent water changes
and strong filtration are essential to manage their waste and maintain a healthy environment.

## Compatibility

Maylandia lombardoi is highly territorial and aggressive, especially during breeding. They are best kept in species-only
tanks or with other robust Mbuna cichlids of similar temperament. Avoid housing them with peaceful or smaller fish.

## Breeding

Breeding Maylandia lombardoi is relatively easy in captivity. They are maternal mouthbrooders, with the female
incubating the eggs in her mouth for about 21-28 days. Provide flat rocks or caves for spawning. Feed the fry with
finely crushed flakes or baby brine shrimp for optimal growth.
