## Overview

The Banded Mountain Loach is a small, peaceful fish found in freshwater rivers and streams of Southeast Asia. In the
wild, these loaches prefer areas with gentle currents and sandy or gravel substrates. They grow to 5–7 cm in length and
are distinguished by their characteristic body pattern: a series of dark spots along their sides, including a spot at
the base of the tail that resembles an eye. This "eyed" spot near the caudal fin serves as a defensive mechanism,
distracting predators from vital body parts.

This species is exclusively bottom-dwelling, spending its time searching for food. This behavior makes it an excellent
"janitor" fish, helping to clean up leftover food and detritus.

Acanthocobitis Uropthalmus is an active bottom-dweller, particularly during twilight hours. It thrives in aquariums with
live plants, driftwood, and rocks as hiding places. With proper care, this fish can live 3–5 years, remaining a
fascinating and hardy addition to community tanks.

Sexual dimorphism is evident in body shape and size. Males are generally slimmer and display brighter colors,
particularly during the breeding season. Females have rounder bodies, especially around the abdomen, which becomes more
prominent when ready to spawn. Males may exhibit increased activity and competitiveness when other males are present.

## Habitat and Tank Requirements

Banded Mountain Loach is best kept in groups of 4–6 individuals. These social fish feel more comfortable in the company
of their own kind, displaying natural behavior, reduced stress, and interesting interactions. Keeping them alone can
lead to stress and inactivity. If planning to house a pair, ensure the tank conditions meet their needs to minimize
potential conflicts, especially between males.

A well-equipped tank of at least 80 liters is necessary for their comfort. Ideal water temperature ranges from 22 to
26°C, pH between 6.5 and 7.5, and general hardness (GH) between 5 and 12. They thrive in tanks with a soft substrate
such as sand or fine gravel and numerous hiding places made of rocks, driftwood, and plants. A gentle water flow
simulates their natural habitat, promoting activity and health. Regular water changes and efficient filtration are
essential to maintain water quality.

## Diet and Feeding

In the wild, the Spotted Acanthocobitis feeds on small invertebrates, algae, and detritus. In captivity, provide a
varied diet including high-quality sinking pellets, algae wafers, and live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine
shrimp, and daphnia. Sinking pellets designed for catfish are ideal, as they reach the tank's bottom where this fish
prefers to feed.

Feed them one to two small meals daily to ensure proper nutrition. It's crucial that the food reaches the bottom of the
tank, where the loach can access it.

## Care and Maintenance

The Banded Mountain Loach is relatively easy to care for as long as good tank conditions are maintained. Weekly water
changes of 20–25% help keep the water clean and free of toxins. Regularly monitor water parameters, especially pH and
hardness, to ensure they remain within acceptable ranges. This fish is sensitive to poor water quality, so an effective
filtration system and consistent tank maintenance are critical. Watch for signs of stress or illness, and maintain
stable conditions for their well-being.

## Compatibility

The Banded Mountain Loach is a peaceful bottom-dwelling fish that pairs well with other small, non-aggressive species.
Below are recommended tank mates for a beautiful and harmonious aquarium setup.

### Recommended Tank Mates

1. **Tetras**

- **[Neons](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [Cardinals](/en/tanichthys-albonubes), Black Neons**: Their vibrant colors and
  active swimming create a contrast with the calmer Spotted Acanthocobitis.
- **Bloodfin Tetra**: Adds a striking touch with its red fins.

2. **Rasboras**

- **[Harlequin Rasbora (Trigonostigma heteromorpha)](/en/trigonostigma-heteromorpha)**: Active small fish that occupy
  upper and mid-water levels, leaving the bottom undisturbed.
- **[Celestial Pearl Danio (Danio margaritatus)](/en/danio-margaritatus)**: Perfect for planted nano tanks.

3. **Small Gouramis**

- **[Honey Gourami](/en/trichogaster-chuna)** and **Pearl Gourami**: Peaceful fish that blend well in planted aquariums
  with the loach.

4. **Other Bottom-Dwellers**

- **[Ancistrus sp.](/en/ancistrus-sp)**: Help clean the aquarium without competing with the Spotted Acanthocobitis.
- **Corydoras Catfish**: Such as [Adolfo's Cory](/en/corydoras-adolfoi) or [Panda Cory](/en/corydoras-panda), share
  similar habits and complement the loach.

5. **Small Barbs**

- **[Cherry Barb (Pethia conchonius)](/en/pethia-conchonius)**: A peaceful barb that adds vibrant colors.

6. **Other Loaches**

- **Zebra Loach (Botia striata)** and **Dwarf Chain Loach**: Similar in behavior but diversify the bottom layer of the
  tank.

7. **Labyrinth Fish**

- **Betta Imbellis**: Their peaceful variant coexists well with bottom-dwellers.

### Compatibility Tips

- **Avoid large or aggressive species**, such as cichlids, larger barbs, or big catfish, which may intimidate or
  outcompete the Spotted Acanthocobitis.
- **Group Housing**: Keeping 4–6 loaches together promotes better behavior and a more interesting display.

Compatible tank mates create a visually appealing and biologically balanced aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding the Spotted Acanthocobitis in captivity is challenging and rarely achieved in home aquariums. They are
egg-scatterers, and successful breeding often requires a dedicated spawning tank with soft water and a temperature at
the upper range of their tolerance (around 26°C). Provide fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for the female to deposit
eggs. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent egg predation. Eggs typically hatch in a few days, and fry can be fed
infusoria or freshly hatched brine shrimp.
