## Overview

**Gymnotus carapo**, commonly known as the Banded Knifefish or Carapo Knifefish, is a species of freshwater fish native
to the rivers and floodplains of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, eel-like body, dark bands running
vertically along its sides, and its ability to generate weak electric fields for navigation and communication. This
nocturnal species prefers slow-moving or still waters with dense vegetation and is known for its unique swimming style,
using an undulating fin along the underside of its body.

## Tank Requirements

The Banded Knifefish requires a large aquarium of at least 200 liters (53 gallons) due to its potential size and need
for space to move. Water temperature should be maintained between 23-28°C (73-82°F), with a pH level of 6.0-8.0 and a
general hardness (GH) of 5-15. The tank should be well-planted with plenty of hiding places, such as driftwood, caves,
and dense vegetation, to mimic its natural habitat. It is essential to provide a soft substrate to protect the fish's
delicate skin.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Gymnotus carapo** feeds on small fish, insects, and crustaceans. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of
high-quality carnivorous fish pellets, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small pieces of fish
or shrimp. They are nocturnal feeders, so it is best to feed them in the evening or when the tank lights are dimmed to
mimic their natural feeding conditions.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Banded Knifefish requires maintaining excellent water quality, as they are sensitive to poor conditions.
Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended to keep nitrate levels low. It is crucial to have a good
filtration system, as they can produce a significant amount of waste. Additionally, regular monitoring of water
parameters is necessary to prevent stress and disease.

## Compatibility

The Banded Knifefish is moderately aggressive and territorial, particularly towards its own species or similar-looking
fish. It is best kept with other peaceful fish that are too large to be considered prey and do not occupy the same niche
in the aquarium. Avoid keeping them with small, fast-moving fish or other knifefish to prevent conflict.

## Breeding

Breeding **Gymnotus carapo** in captivity is rare and challenging due to their specific environmental and behavioral
requirements. They are known to be bubble nest builders, but replicating the precise conditions they need to spawn is
difficult. Providing a large, dimly lit tank with plenty of hiding places may encourage natural breeding behaviors. If
successful, the male will guard the nest and the fry until they are free-swimming. Feeding the fry with live baby brine
shrimp or specialized fry foods is essential for their growth and survival.
