## Overview

**Epalzeorhynchos frenatum**, commonly known as the Rainbow Shark or Red-Finned Shark, is a popular freshwater fish
native to the rivers of Southeast Asia. This species is recognized for its vibrant coloration, featuring a dark body
with bright red or orange fins. They typically reach a size of 15-20 cm and have a lifespan of 5 to 8 years.

Rainbow Sharks are semi-aggressive and territorial, especially as they mature. They thrive in a well-planted aquarium
with plenty of hiding spots, making them an exciting addition to community tanks with compatible species.

## Tank Requirements

**Epalzeorhynchos frenatum** prefer slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and a general
hardness (GH) of 5-12 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-27Â°C, and they should be kept in a tank
with a minimum volume of 200 liters.

A well-structured aquarium with plenty of decorations and caves is essential for providing hiding spots. These fish are
known for their territorial behavior, so ample space is crucial to minimize aggression.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Epalzeorhynchos frenatum** are omnivorous and feed on a variety of plant matter and small invertebrates.
In captivity, they accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and a variety of frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp,
bloodworms, and vegetable matter.

To maintain their health and vibrancy, it's important to provide a balanced diet that includes both protein-rich foods
and plant-based options. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, offering only what they can consume within a few
minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Rainbow Sharks are relatively easy to care for but require good water quality. Regular water changes of 20-30% each week
are necessary to maintain a clean environment. A reliable filtration system is essential for keeping the water
well-oxygenated.

These fish can be territorial, especially towards their own species, so it's best to keep them in larger tanks or with
other non-aggressive species to reduce conflicts.

## Compatibility

**Epalzeorhynchos frenatum** are best kept with other semi-aggressive fish that can hold their own. Suitable tankmates
include larger tetras, barbs, and peaceful cichlids. Avoid keeping them with small or very docile fish, as they may
become targets of aggression.

Providing ample space and hiding spots will help reduce territorial disputes and ensure a harmonious environment for
these vibrant fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Epalzeorhynchos frenatum** in captivity can be challenging, as they are not commonly bred by hobbyists. If
attempted, a separate breeding tank with suitable spawning sites, such as flat rocks or broad-leaved plants, is
recommended.

The female will scatter eggs over the spawning sites, and once the fry hatch, they can be fed infusoria or finely
crushed flakes. It's crucial to separate the fry from the adults to prevent them from being eaten.
