## Overview

The Dwarf Oto (_Macrotocinclus affinis_), also known as the Dwarf Suckermouth Catfish, is a small, peaceful species from
the Loricariidae family. Native to South American rivers, it is popular among aquarists for its algae-eating
capabilities and gentle nature. Its small size and calm temperament make it suitable for community tanks with other
non-aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

Dwarf Otos require a minimum tank size of 40 liters, with a temperature range of 22-28°C, pH of 6.0-7.5, and GH of 6-15.
A well-planted tank with hiding spots, driftwood, and gentle water flow is ideal. These fish are sensitive to water
quality and prefer stable conditions with minimal fluctuations.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Dwarf Otos feed primarily on algae and biofilm. In aquariums, they should be provided with a steady supply
of algae, supplemented with algae wafers and blanched vegetables like zucchini and cucumber. They may not adapt well to
flake foods, so a diet rich in plant-based options is essential.

## Care and Maintenance

These fish are sensitive to poor water conditions, so regular water changes and a well-maintained filter are important.
A 20-30% water change weekly helps keep conditions stable. Avoid sudden changes in water parameters, as Otos are prone
to stress and may be sensitive to toxins.

## Compatibility

Dwarf Otos are peaceful and do well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species like tetras, rasboras,
and shrimp. They are best kept in groups of at least six, as they are social fish that enjoy the company of their own
kind.

## Breeding

Breeding Dwarf Otos in captivity is challenging but possible. They require stable, high-quality water and plenty of live
plants. During breeding, females will scatter eggs among plants or on aquarium glass. Once spawning occurs, it’s best to
separate adults from the eggs, as they may eat the eggs. The fry can be fed with infusoria and algae as they grow.
