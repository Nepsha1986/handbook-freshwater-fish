## Overview

Parachromis managuensis, commonly known as the Jaguar Cichlid, is a large and powerful cichlid species native to Central
America, particularly found in lakes and rivers of Honduras and Nicaragua. This species is known for its distinctive
jaguar-like pattern, which gives it its common name. The Jaguar Cichlid is a popular choice among experienced aquarists
who are looking for a bold and aggressive fish with a striking appearance. However, due to its size and temperament, it
requires a spacious tank and careful management of tank mates.

## Tank Requirements

Given their large size and aggressive nature, Jaguar Cichlids require a spacious aquarium with robust filtration to
maintain water quality. A tank size of at least 450 liters is recommended to provide ample space for swimming and
territorial behavior. The ideal water temperature should be maintained between 24-30°C, with a pH level of 7.0-8.7 and
water hardness of 10-20 dGH. The tank should be decorated with sturdy rocks, driftwood, and caves to create hiding spots
and establish territories. It's essential to provide a secure tank lid, as Jaguar Cichlids are powerful and may jump out
of the tank.

## Feeding and Diet

Parachromis managuensis is a carnivorous species that primarily feeds on other fish in the wild. In the aquarium, they
should be offered a diet of high-quality carnivorous pellets, live or frozen foods such as shrimp, fish fillets, and
insects. It's important to provide a varied diet to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients. Avoid feeding them
live feeder fish, as this can introduce diseases and encourage aggressive behavior. Instead, offer frozen or prepared
foods that mimic their natural diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Jaguar Cichlids involves regular tank maintenance and close monitoring of water parameters to ensure a stable
environment. Weekly water changes of 20-30% are recommended to keep nitrate levels low and maintain water quality. Due
to their large size and high waste output, a powerful filtration system is necessary to keep the water clean. It's also
important to monitor their behavior closely, as they can be highly territorial and aggressive, particularly during
breeding. Ensure that tank mates are chosen carefully and provide enough space to minimize conflicts.

## Compatibility

Jaguar Cichlids are highly territorial and aggressive, particularly as they mature. They are best kept in a species-only
tank or with other large, robust fish that can hold their own. Suitable tank mates include other large cichlids such as
Oscars or Texas Cichlids, provided the tank is spacious enough to accommodate their territorial needs. Smaller or more
peaceful fish should be avoided, as they may be seen as prey or bullied by the Jaguar Cichlid. It's also advisable to
keep them with only one or two other large fish to minimize aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Parachromis managuensis in the home aquarium is possible but can be challenging due to their aggressive nature.
They are substrate spawners, and the breeding pair will choose a flat surface such as a rock or piece of driftwood to
lay their eggs. To encourage breeding, maintain a stable temperature around 28-30°C and provide plenty of flat surfaces
in the tank. The female can lay up to 5,000 eggs, which the male will then fertilize. Both parents are highly protective
of their eggs and fry, and their aggression may increase during this time. It's essential to provide ample space and
hiding spots for the fry once they become free-swimming.
