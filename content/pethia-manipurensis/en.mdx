## Overview

**Pethia manipurensis**, commonly known as the Manipur Barb, is a small and peaceful species from the Cyprinidae family.
Native to the freshwater bodies of Manipur in northeastern India, this species is well-suited to community aquariums,
especially those that are heavily planted. Manipur Barbs thrive in groups and display vibrant colors, particularly when
kept in clean, well-maintained aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

The Manipur Barb does well in aquariums of at least 50 liters (around 13 gallons). The water temperature should be
maintained between 22-26°C (72-79°F), with a pH level of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 4-15. A well-planted
tank with gentle water flow and shaded areas is ideal for this species. They are best kept in soft, slightly acidic
water to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, **Pethia manipurensis** feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they will
accept a wide variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, small pellets, and live or frozen food such as brine
shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. To maintain their vibrant colors, it is recommended to provide a balanced diet with
occasional feedings of vegetable matter.

## Care and Maintenance

Manipur Barbs are easy to care for, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. They are best kept in schools of at
least six individuals to encourage natural behavior and reduce stress. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly will help
maintain water quality. As they prefer planted aquariums, regular trimming and cleaning of plants will ensure a healthy
environment.

## Compatibility

These barbs are peaceful and get along well with other small, non-aggressive species. They can be housed with other
community fish like rasboras, tetras, and Corydoras. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish that may view
them as prey. Manipur Barbs are known for their peaceful nature, making them an excellent addition to any community
aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pethia manipurensis** in home aquariums is possible but can be a challenge. They are egg scatterers, and
breeding typically occurs in a well-planted tank with fine-leaved plants or spawning mops. After the eggs are laid, the
adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 24-48 hours, and the fry should be
fed with infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to eat finely crushed flake food.
