## Overview

**Sawbwa resplendens**, commonly referred to as the **Asian Rummynose** or **Rummynose Rasbora**, is a beautiful small
fish native to Inle Lake in Myanmar. With their bright red nose and silver-blue body, they are a striking addition to
any aquarium. These fish typically grow to around 3-4 cm in length and have a lifespan of 3-5 years. Their peaceful
nature and small size make them ideal for community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

The **Asian Rummynose** thrives in tanks of at least 60 liters, with water temperatures between 22-26Â°C, a pH of
6.5-7.5, and general hardness (GH) between 5-12. A well-planted tank with plenty of hiding spaces and moderate lighting
is essential for their well-being. They prefer slightly softer water, so using driftwood or peat filtration can help
maintain optimal water conditions. The tank should have a gentle water flow to simulate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

**Sawbwa resplendens** are omnivores, primarily feeding on small invertebrates, algae, and plant matter in the wild. In
an aquarium setting, they readily accept high-quality flake foods, micro-pellets, and frozen or live foods such as
daphnia, brine shrimp, and bloodworms. A varied diet will help maintain their bright colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

The **Asian Rummynose** is relatively easy to care for, provided that water conditions are stable and the tank is
well-maintained. Perform regular water changes of around 20-25% weekly to ensure water quality. They are sensitive to
fluctuations in water parameters, so maintaining a stable environment is key to their health.

## Compatibility

These peaceful fish do well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species like tetras, danios, and
rasboras. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species that may bully or outcompete them for food. They also
enjoy the company of their own kind, so keeping them in groups of at least six individuals will reduce stress and bring
out their natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding **Sawbwa resplendens** in captivity can be moderately difficult. They are egg scatterers, and breeding is often
triggered by warmer temperatures and an abundance of live food. A separate breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic
water and fine-leaved plants for egg deposition is recommended. Once eggs are laid, the adults should be removed to
prevent them from eating the eggs. The fry are very small and require infusoria or liquid fry food initially, followed
by baby brine shrimp as they grow.
