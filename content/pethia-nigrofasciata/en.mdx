## Overview

The Black Ruby Barb (_Pethia nigrofasciata_), a member of the Cyprinidae family, is known for its vibrant colors that
intensify during mating. Native to the freshwater rivers and streams of Sri Lanka, this species has a distinctive
appearance with a deep red body and contrasting black vertical bands.

## Tank Requirements

To maintain a healthy Black Ruby Barb, a tank size of at least 60 liters is recommended. The water temperature should be
kept between 20-25°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5. The tank should be equipped with a gentle filter, and a well-planted
environment is preferred, allowing plenty of open swimming space and hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet

Black Ruby Barbs are omnivorous and thrive on a varied diet of high-quality flakes, pellets, and occasional treats like
brine shrimp and bloodworms. It’s ideal to feed them small portions multiple times a day to simulate natural feeding
patterns.

## Care and Maintenance

Routine tank maintenance includes weekly water changes of around 20-30%, along with regular monitoring of water
parameters to prevent disease. They are generally hardy but can be susceptible to common freshwater diseases if water
quality is neglected.

## Compatibility

This species is peaceful and does well in community tanks. Suitable tank mates include other barbs, tetras, and bottom
dwellers. However, avoid keeping them with fin-nipping or overly aggressive species, as they are relatively gentle.

## Breeding

Black Ruby Barbs are moderately challenging to breed. A separate breeding tank with slightly warmer water, fine-leaved
plants, and a soft substrate can encourage spawning. Males display brighter colors to attract females. After spawning,
remove the parents to protect the eggs and care for the fry with infusoria or other suitable fry food.
