## Overview

**Synodontis petricola**, commonly referred to as the Dwarf Petricola Catfish, is a small, peaceful catfish species
belonging to the family Mochokidae. Native to the rocky shores of Lake Tanganyika in Africa, this species is admired for
its adaptability and relatively easy care requirements. Synodontis petricola grows to a size of about 10-12 cm (4-5
inches) and can live for 8-15 years in captivity. It is primarily nocturnal, making it most active during the evening
and night. This catfish is a popular choice for African cichlid community tanks due to its ability to thrive in similar
water conditions and its generally peaceful temperament.

## Tank Requirements

Synodontis petricola thrives in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 150 liters (40 gallons). The water
temperature should be kept between 23-28°C (73-82°F), with a pH range of 7.5-8.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 8-20.
The tank should mimic their natural rocky habitat, providing numerous hiding spots using rocks, caves, and sturdy
decorations to reduce stress and encourage natural behaviors. It is best kept in groups of at least 3-5 individuals, as
they are social fish and exhibit more natural behaviors when in the company of conspecifics.

## Feeding and Diet

Synodontis petricola is omnivorous and benefits from a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on a mix of invertebrates,
algae, and detritus. In an aquarium setting, they should be provided with a balanced diet consisting of high-quality
sinking pellets or wafers, along with live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Occasional
offerings of vegetable matter, like blanched spinach or spirulina-based foods, can help maintain their health and
vibrant coloration. Feeding should align with their nocturnal nature, preferably in the evening or at night.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Synodontis petricola is relatively straightforward, making them suitable for aquarists with moderate
experience. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary to maintain water quality and prevent the buildup of
toxins. Ensuring a clean substrate and providing ample hiding places will help minimize stress and promote natural
behaviors. These catfish are generally hardy and can tolerate a range of water conditions, but it is important to avoid
drastic changes in water parameters, which can cause stress or health issues.

## Compatibility

Synodontis petricola is a great choice for community aquariums, especially with African cichlids that share similar
water parameter requirements. They are peaceful and get along well with most cichlids from Lake Tanganyika, such as
Julidochromis, Neolamprologus, and Altolamprologus species. Other suitable tank mates include other Synodontis species,
as well as robust tetras and barbs that can handle similar water conditions. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive
or highly territorial fish that could harass them.

## Breeding

Breeding Synodontis petricola in captivity can be moderately challenging but rewarding. They are egg scatterers and tend
to spawn in caves or crevices. To encourage breeding, provide a well-maintained tank with stable water conditions and
plenty of hiding spots. A higher protein diet of live or frozen foods can help condition them for spawning. Once the
eggs are laid, they should hatch in about 3-5 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food until
they are large enough to accept larger food items. A dedicated breeding tank may improve the chances of survival for the
fry, as adult fish may eat the eggs or fry if left in the community tank.
