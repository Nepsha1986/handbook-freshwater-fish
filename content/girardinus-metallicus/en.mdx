## Overview

**Girardinus metallicus**, commonly known as the **Metallic Livebearer** or **Metallic Girardinus**, is a striking
freshwater fish native to Central America. This species is recognized for its beautiful metallic sheen, which varies in
color from gold to silver. Growing up to 4-5 cm in length, it is a hardy and active fish, making it a popular choice for
freshwater aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

**Girardinus metallicus** thrives in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 50 liters. The water
temperature should be kept between 22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-15. A
well-filtered tank with regular water changes is essential to maintain water quality. Providing a planted tank with some
open swimming space and hiding spots will enhance the fish's well-being.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Metallic Livebearers** feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed a
varied diet including high-quality flake foods, live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and finely chopped
vegetables. A balanced diet will promote vibrant coloration and overall health. Feed them small amounts 1-2 times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Girardinus metallicus** involves maintaining clean and stable water conditions. Perform regular water
changes of 20-30% weekly to prevent the buildup of waste. Monitor water parameters regularly and adjust as needed to
keep them within the ideal range. This species is relatively hardy but should still be monitored for any signs of
illness or stress.

## Compatibility

**Girardinus metallicus** is generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tank
mates include other livebearers, small tetras, and peaceful bottom-dwellers. Avoid housing them with larger or
aggressive species that might intimidate or harass them. Providing a well-balanced community tank will help ensure their
well-being.

## Breeding

Breeding **Girardinus metallicus** in captivity is relatively straightforward. They are livebearers, meaning they give
birth to free-swimming fry rather than laying eggs. To encourage breeding, maintain stable water conditions and provide
a variety of food options. Pregnant females will carry the fry until they are ready to be born. It is helpful to have a
separate breeding tank or provide plenty of hiding spots to protect the young from being eaten by adults.
