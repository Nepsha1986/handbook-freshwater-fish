## Overview

The Starlight Bristlenose Catfish (_Ancistrus cirrhosus_), also known as the Starry Bristlenose or Starlight Bristlenose
Pleco, is one of the most popular and recognizable members of the armored catfish family (Loricariidae). Native to
fast-flowing rivers and tributaries of South America, primarily in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, this species was first
scientifically described in 1840. Its popularity among aquarists stems not only from its attractive appearance but also
from its useful function of cleaning the aquarium of algae growth.

The distinctive feature of _Ancistrus cirrhosus_ is its unique coloration: a dark, almost black body covered with
numerous small, bright white or yellowish spots resembling a scattering of stars in the night sky. Some individuals may
have larger spots or even faint stripes, making each fish uniquely beautiful. Unlike many other bristlenose catfish that
may have duller or more uniform coloring, the "Starlight" variant stands out with its decorative appeal.

Adults reach a size of 8-10 cm, with females typically slightly larger and fuller than males. Lifespan in a
well-maintained aquarium is 8-12 years. Males are distinguished by more developed "whiskers" or fleshy growths on their
heads, which are either absent or significantly less pronounced in females. These growths become especially noticeable
during the breeding season.

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Starlight Bristlenose Catfish is a valuable helper in the aquarium, actively scraping
algae from surfaces and consuming food remnants, contributing to maintaining biological balance and water cleanliness.

## Tank Requirements

For successful keeping of the Starlight Bristlenose Catfish (_Ancistrus cirrhosus_), it's essential to create conditions
as close as possible to its natural habitat. These catfish, like most of their relatives, prefer clean, well-aerated
water with moderate current.

- **Tank Volume:** The minimum volume for a single specimen is 80 liters. However, considering their territoriality,
  especially among males, an aquarium of 120-150 liters is recommended for keeping a pair or small group. A larger
  volume promotes water parameter stability and reduces the likelihood of conflicts.

- **Water Temperature:** The optimal range is 24-28°C. It's important to maintain a stable temperature without sudden
  fluctuations using a reliable heater with a thermostat.

- **Water Parameters:**

  - **pH:** 6.5-7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral)
  - **General Hardness (GH):** 6-12 dGH (soft to moderately hard)
  - **Ammonia, Nitrites:** 0 ppm
  - **Nitrates:** \<20 ppm Regular water testing will help monitor these parameters.

- **Lighting:** Starlight Bristlenose Catfish are primarily crepuscular and nocturnal, preferring subdued lighting.
  Bright light can cause stress and make them hide. Using floating plants or driftwood to create shaded areas is
  recommended.

- **Tank Setup:**

  - **Substrate:** Use soft, non-sharp substrate such as sand or fine gravel to avoid damaging the fish's sensitive
    barbels.
  - **Hiding Spots:** Plenty of hiding places are essential: rock caves, ceramic grottos, coconut shell halves. Special
    attention should be given to **natural driftwood**, which not only serves as shelter but also provides cellulose
    necessary for bristlenose digestion. Wood also helps maintain a slightly acidic environment.
  - **Plants:** Live plants are welcome, but choose hard-leaved species such as Anubias, ferns, or Cryptocorynes, as
    bristlenose catfish may nibble on soft leaves.

- **Water Flow:** Moderate current, mimicking natural conditions, is beneficial for these fish and promotes better water
  aeration.

## Feeding and Diet

The Starlight Bristlenose Catfish is primarily herbivorous, and its diet should be rich in plant-based foods. Proper,
balanced nutrition is critically important for its health, vibrant coloring, and longevity.

- **Main Diet:**

  - **High-quality sinking tablets and pellets for catfish:** Choose foods high in spirulina and other plant components.
    They should be specifically designed for bottom-dwelling fish so the food reaches the bottom where the bristlenose
    can find it.
  - **Natural algae:** Bristlenose catfish actively scrape algae growth from aquarium walls, decorations, and plants.
    This is their natural food source.
  - **Vegetables:** Regularly offer fresh vegetables such as:
    - **Zucchini, cucumbers:** Slice into rounds and attach to the glass with a suction cup or weight them down.
    - **Spinach, lettuce leaves:** Blanch with boiling water first and secure at the bottom.
    - **Broccoli, green peas:** Can be given in small amounts after boiling and mashing.
  - **Driftwood:** Natural driftwood in the aquarium not only creates hiding spots but also serves as a source of
    cellulose necessary for bristlenose digestion. They will constantly scrape soft fibers from it.

- **Supplemental Feeding (in moderation):**

  - **Frozen foods:** Bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia can be offered 1-2 times per week as a protein supplement.
    However, don't overdo protein foods, as excess can lead to digestive problems and liver disease.
  - **Live foods:** Occasionally live bloodworms or tubifex can be given, but ensure they're clean and parasite-free.

- **Feeding Schedule:** Feed bristlenose catfish once daily, preferably in the evening or after lights out, as they're
  most active during twilight hours. Give only as much food as they can consume within a few hours to avoid overfeeding
  and water pollution.

**Important:** Never overfeed bristlenose catfish. Uneaten food quickly decomposes, degrading water quality and creating
health risks for all aquarium inhabitants.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Starlight Bristlenose Catfish isn't particularly difficult, making it an excellent choice even for
beginner aquarists. However, maintaining its health and activity requires following several important rules:

- **Regular Water Changes:** Weekly water changes of 25-30% of aquarium volume with fresh, dechlorinated water are
  necessary. This helps maintain stable water parameters and remove accumulated nitrates and other harmful substances.
  Use a water conditioner to neutralize chlorine and chloramines.

- **Filtration:** An effective filtration system is mandatory. External canister filters or powerful internal filters
  with good mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration will ensure necessary water cleanliness. Regularly rinse
  filter media, but not all at once to avoid disrupting beneficial bacteria colonies.

- **Aeration:** Good water aeration is extremely important, especially at higher temperatures. Use an air pump with a
  diffuser or ensure surface water movement from the filter to oxygenate the water.

- **Substrate Cleaning:** Regularly siphon the substrate, especially in areas where food remnants and waste accumulate.
  This prevents the formation of anaerobic zones and release of toxic gases.

- **Water Parameter Monitoring:** Regularly test water for pH, GH, KH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. This allows
  timely detection of deviations and corrective action.

- **Fish Observation:** Daily inspect your bristlenose catfish for changes in behavior, coloration, injuries, or signs
  of disease. A healthy bristlenose is active, has vibrant coloring, and well-developed fins.

- **Stress Prevention:** Avoid sudden changes in water parameters, tank overcrowding, and housing with aggressive fish.
  Provide sufficient hiding spots so the fish feels safe.

## Compatibility

The Starlight Bristlenose Catfish is a peaceful and calm catfish that gets along excellently with most non-aggressive
freshwater fish. Its bottom-dwelling lifestyle and primarily vegetarian diet make it an excellent neighbor for many
species.

- **Ideal Tankmates:**

  - **Small and medium tetras:** [Neons](/en/paracheirodon-innesi),
    [white cloud mountain minnows](/en/tanichthys-albonubes), rummy-nose tetras, glowlight tetras.
  - **Rasboras:** [Harlequin rasbora](/en/trigonostigma-heteromorpha), [celestial pearl danio](/en/danio-margaritatus).
  - **Small livebearers:** Guppies, swordtails, mollies (provided similar water parameters).
  - **Peaceful cichlids:** For example, [angelfish](/en/pterophyllum-scalare) (with sufficient tank volume and hiding
    spots for the bristlenose).
  - **Other bottom dwellers:** [Corydoras](/en/corydoras-aeneus), otocinclus, other peaceful catfish.
  - **Labyrinth fish:** Gouramis, dwarf gouramis.

- **Species to Avoid:**

  - **Large and aggressive cichlids:** Such as oscars, cichlasomas, which may view the bristlenose as food or
    territorial competition.
  - **Fin-nipping fish:** Some barb species (e.g., tiger barbs) that may damage the bristlenose's fins.
  - **Very small and slow fish:** Although bristlenose aren't predators, very small fry or weakened fish may
    accidentally suffer.

- **Intraspecies Compatibility:**
  - Male bristlenose catfish may show territoriality toward each other, especially if the tank is too small or lacks
    adequate hiding spots. It's recommended to keep one male or a group of several females with one male in a spacious
    tank with plenty of individual hiding spots.
  - When keeping multiple bristlenose catfish, ensure each has its own cave or driftwood where it can shelter.

## Breeding

Breeding the Starlight Bristlenose Catfish in home aquariums is not only possible but occurs quite frequently when
optimal conditions are provided. It's a fascinating process that allows observing the male's parental behavior.

- **Spawning Preparation:**

  - **Breeding Tank:** For intentional breeding, a separate breeding tank of at least 50 liters is recommended. This
    allows controlling water parameters and protecting fry from being eaten by other inhabitants.
  - **Water Parameters:** Spawning can be stimulated by a slight temperature decrease (2-3°C) followed by gradual
    increase to 26-28°C, as well as frequent water changes (2-3 times weekly, 20-30%) with softer, slightly acidic
    water.
  - **Breeding Shelters:** Specialized breeding shelters are essential – ceramic tubes, hollow driftwood, or caves where
    the male can establish a nest. The shelter size should allow the male to turn around freely, but with a sufficiently
    narrow entrance.
  - **Feeding:** Breeders should be fed abundantly with high-quality plant and protein foods (bloodworms, brine shrimp,
    tubifex) for 1-2 weeks before expected spawning.

- **Spawning Process:**

  - The male selects a shelter and thoroughly cleans it. He then actively invites the female, displaying his "whiskers"
    and vibrating his body.
  - The female deposits 30 to 100 large, bright yellow or orange eggs on the inner surface of the shelter.
  - After egg-laying, the female leaves the nest, and all care for the offspring is taken over by the male. He guards
    the eggs, fans them with his fins to provide fresh water flow, and removes unfertilized or spoiled eggs.

- **Fry Care:**
  - The incubation period lasts 4-7 days, after which larvae hatch. They feed on their yolk sac for another 3-5 days,
    remaining in the shelter under the male's supervision.
  - Once the fry begin swimming freely and actively searching for food, the male can be removed.
  - **First Foods:** Fry are fed finely crushed spirulina tablets, specialized catfish fry foods, and blanched, mashed
    vegetables (spinach, cucumber). It's important to ensure constant food availability.
  - **Water Cleanliness:** Water cleanliness is extremely important in the fry tank. Daily small water changes (10-15%)
    and careful bottom siphoning help prevent organic buildup.

Breeding the Starlight Bristlenose Catfish is not only an opportunity to obtain new offspring but also a unique
experience observing the complex and interesting behavior of these fish.
