## Overview

**Dawkinsia rohani**, commonly referred to as Rohan’s Barb, is a vibrant freshwater species from the Cyprinidae family.
Native to the rivers and streams of the Western Ghats in India, this fish is distinguished by its shimmering scales and
flowing fins. They are peaceful, schooling fish that are ideal for larger community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Rohan’s Barb requires a spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 120 liters (32 gallons). The water temperature should
range from 22-28°C (72-82°F), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5, and a general hardness (GH) of 5-15. They thrive in tanks
that mimic their natural environment, with a soft substrate, driftwood, and a combination of live plants. Strong water
flow replicating their riverine habitat is also beneficial.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Dawkinsia rohani** feed on a variety of small invertebrates, plant matter, and organic debris. In
captivity, they should be offered a high-quality diet consisting of flakes, pellets, and live or frozen foods such as
bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Supplementing their diet with vegetable matter, such as blanched spinach or
spirulina flakes, will ensure balanced nutrition.

## Care and Maintenance

Rohan’s Barb is relatively easy to care for, provided that water quality is maintained through regular water changes and
proper filtration. They should be kept in groups of at least six to ensure their social needs are met. They are active
swimmers, so ample swimming space should be provided.

## Compatibility

These peaceful fish can be housed with other similarly sized, non-aggressive species such as tetras, rasboras, and
danios. Avoid housing them with overly aggressive fish, as this can lead to stress and aggression. Their calm nature
makes them an excellent choice for community tanks.

## Breeding

Breeding **Dawkinsia rohani** is possible in captivity, though challenging. They are egg scatterers, and spawning is
often triggered by an increase in water temperature and flow. After spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent
them from consuming the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 48 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely
crushed flake food.
