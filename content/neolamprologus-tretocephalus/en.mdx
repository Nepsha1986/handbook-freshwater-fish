## Overview

**Neolamprologus tretocephalus**, commonly called the Five-Bar Cichlid, is a visually striking species known for its
bold black and white vertical stripes. Native to Lake Tanganyika, this fish is highly territorial and best suited for
experienced aquarists who can provide a carefully planned tank setup.

## Tank Requirements

A spacious aquarium of at least 200 liters is necessary for this territorial species. Include plenty of rock structures
and caves to provide hiding spaces and establish territories. The water should be maintained at a temperature of
24-27Â°C, with a pH between 7.8-9.0 and a hardness of 8-20 dGH. Strong filtration and regular water changes are essential
to mimic its natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Neolamprologus tretocephalus feeds on small invertebrates and other protein-rich sources. In captivity,
provide a diet of high-quality pellets or flakes formulated for cichlids, supplemented with live or frozen foods like
brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia.

## Care and Maintenance

This species requires intermediate to advanced care due to its territorial nature and specific water requirements.
Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly and consistent monitoring of water parameters are essential. Provide adequate
space to reduce aggression and avoid overcrowding.

## Compatibility

Neolamprologus tretocephalus is best housed in a species-only tank or with other similarly sized and equally aggressive
Lake Tanganyika cichlids. Avoid keeping them with smaller or less aggressive species, as they may be harassed or harmed.
Pairing a single male with one or more females often works best.

## Breeding

Breeding this species can be challenging due to their territorial behavior. They are cave spawners, with the female
laying eggs in a secluded area. The male guards the territory, while the female tends to the eggs and fry. Provide
plenty of hiding spots and ensure excellent water quality to encourage breeding. Feed the fry with finely crushed flake
food or baby brine shrimp.
