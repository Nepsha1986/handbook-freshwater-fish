## Overview

The Walking Catfish (_Clarias batrachus_) is a unique freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia, known for its ability to
move short distances on land using its pectoral fins. Its adaptability and hardiness allow it to survive in various
conditions, making it a resilient species for experienced aquarists. The fish has a slender, elongated body and is
usually gray or brown with mottled spots, making it well-camouflaged in its environment.

## Tank Requirements

Walking Catfish require a spacious tank of at least 200 liters due to their size and active nature. The water
temperature should be kept between 22-28Â°C with a pH of 6.5-8.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-20. This species
prefers a dimly lit tank with plenty of hiding spots, such as driftwood, caves, and dense vegetation. A secure tank lid
is essential, as these fish are known to escape in search of food or better conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Walking Catfish are omnivorous and consume a variety of plant matter, insects, small fish, and crustaceans.
In an aquarium, they thrive on a balanced diet of sinking pellets, live or frozen foods like bloodworms and shrimp, and
occasional vegetables. Feeding should occur in the evening to suit their nocturnal habits.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining water quality is crucial, as these fish produce a significant amount of waste. Weekly water changes of
25-30% and a strong filtration system are recommended. While the Walking Catfish can tolerate low oxygen levels,
ensuring proper aeration and filtration is essential for a healthy environment.

## Compatibility

Walking Catfish are semi-aggressive and territorial, especially as they grow. Suitable tank mates include larger,
similarly robust fish, such as large cichlids or other catfish species. Avoid housing them with small or delicate
species, as they may be injured or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding Walking Catfish in captivity is challenging due to their specific requirements. They build bubble nests in
shallow water, where the male guards the eggs. Reproducing this environment in an aquarium is difficult, but success has
been achieved in spacious tanks with controlled conditions. Once the eggs hatch, the fry should be separated to prevent
predation by adults.
