## Overview

Nothobranchius rachovii, commonly known as Rachov's nothobranch or Bluefin notho, is a striking species of killifish
belonging to the Nothobranchiidae family. This small, vibrantly colored fish is native to seasonal pools and floodplains
in Mozambique, Africa. The males exhibit brilliant blue and red patterns, making them a popular choice among aquarists.
They are annual fish, meaning they have a short lifespan in the wild due to the seasonal nature of their habitats.

## Tank Requirements

To provide a suitable environment for Nothobranchius rachovii, a tank of at least 20 liters is recommended. The ideal
water temperature should be maintained between 22-26Â°C, with a pH level of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) ranging from
5-15. The tank should be equipped with a gentle filter and a heater to maintain stable water conditions. A dark
substrate, along with plenty of plants and hiding spots, mimics their natural habitat and helps to reduce stress. Low
lighting is also preferred to enhance their vibrant colors.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Nothobranchius rachovii feeds on small invertebrates and insect larvae. In an aquarium setting, they should
be fed a varied diet that includes high-quality flake food, frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and
bloodworms. Feeding them multiple times a day in small amounts ensures they receive the necessary nutrients without
overfeeding the tank.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Nothobranchius rachovii requires regular tank maintenance to ensure optimal water quality. Weekly water
changes of about 20-30% are essential to keep the water clean and free from toxins. It's important to monitor the health
of the fish regularly, looking out for signs of stress or disease. Common health issues include fin rot and fungal
infections, which can be treated with appropriate medications if caught early.

## Compatibility

Nothobranchius rachovii are generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They can be kept with
other small, non-aggressive fish species that thrive in similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates include small
tetras, rasboras, and other peaceful killifish. It's best to avoid keeping them with larger, aggressive fish that might
prey on them or compete for food.

## Breeding

Breeding Nothobranchius rachovii can be a rewarding experience. To encourage breeding, provide a separate breeding tank
with a soft substrate or a spawning mop. The female will lay eggs in the substrate, which will then need to be removed
and kept in moist peat moss to simulate their natural drying period. After a few months, the eggs can be transferred
back to water, where they will hatch within a few days. The fry should be fed infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp
and can be gradually introduced to the adult diet as they grow.
