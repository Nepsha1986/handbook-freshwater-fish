## Overview

**Protomelas taeniolatus**, or the Red Empress, is a stunning cichlid species endemic to Lake Malawi in Africa. Males of
this species are known for their vibrant coloration, blending shades of red, blue, and orange, making them a centerpiece
in any aquarium. Females, on the other hand, have a more subdued appearance, typically displaying brownish-gray tones.

These fish grow to a size of 15-25 cm and have a lifespan of 8-10 years with proper care. **Protomelas taeniolatus** are
relatively peaceful compared to other cichlids, making them suitable for larger community tanks with other Lake Malawi
species. Their striking appearance and moderate care requirements make them an excellent choice for intermediate
aquarists.

## Aquarium Requirements

To keep **Protomelas taeniolatus**, you will need an aquarium with a minimum volume of **300 liters**. This is due to
their size and active nature. Optimal water parameters are:

- **Temperature:** 24-28°C
- **pH:** 7.5-8.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 10-20 dGH

Like other cichlids, they require **high-quality filtration** and regular water changes (20-30% weekly). The aquarium
can be decorated with rocks, caves, and other hiding spots, as these fish enjoy having places to retreat. Plants are not
necessary, but if you choose to include them, opt for hardy species like anubias or vallisneria. Be aware that cichlids
may uproot or damage plants.

**Tip:** Use sand or fine gravel substrate to mimic their natural habitat.

## Diet and Feeding

In the wild, **Protomelas taeniolatus** feed on algae and small invertebrates. In an aquarium, their diet should be
varied and balanced:

- **Staple Food:** High-quality cichlid pellets or flakes.
- **Supplemental Foods:**
  - Live or frozen foods (brine shrimp, bloodworms, krill).
  - Spirulina-based foods to enhance coloration.
- **Feeding Frequency:** 1-2 times a day.

**Important:** Avoid overfeeding to prevent water quality issues and health problems.

## Care and Maintenance

**Protomelas taeniolatus** are relatively hardy, but maintaining high water quality is essential for their health.
Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and a powerful filtration system will help maintain stable conditions.

- **Water Testing:** Regularly check ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.
- **Aeration:** Ensure good oxygenation, as cichlids thrive in well-oxygenated water.
- **Stability:** Avoid sudden changes in water parameters, such as pH or temperature fluctuations, to prevent stress.

**Tip:** Use an external filter for efficient water purification.

## Compatibility

**Protomelas taeniolatus** are generally peaceful, especially compared to more aggressive cichlids. They can be kept
with other Lake Malawi cichlids of similar temperament, such as:

- **Aulonocaras** (peacock cichlids).
- **Other haplochromis species**.
- **Labidochromis** (e.g., yellow lab cichlids).

**Avoid** keeping them with aggressive species like mbuna, as this can lead to conflicts. To minimize aggression,
especially during breeding, it is recommended to keep one male with several females. Providing ample space and hiding
spots will also help maintain a peaceful environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Protomelas taeniolatus** in captivity is possible, and they are mouthbrooders. During breeding, the female
lays eggs, which she then incubates in her mouth for 2-3 weeks. The fry remain in the mother's mouth until they are
ready to swim independently.

- **Breeding Conditions:**
  - Stable water parameters (temperature 26-28°C, pH 7.5-8.5).
  - Flat rocks or other surfaces for egg-laying.
  - High-quality food to encourage spawning.
- **Fry Care:**
  - Once hatched, feed the fry baby brine shrimp or crushed flakes.
  - Separate the fry from adult fish to prevent predation.

**Tip:** If you're a beginner, start with keeping adult fish before attempting breeding.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Aggression Between Fish:**

- Ensure the tank is large enough.
- Add more hiding spots and use rocks to divide territories.

2. **Loss of Vibrant Coloration:**

- Check water quality and diet.
- Add foods rich in carotenoids, such as spirulina.

3. **Stress in Fish:**

- Avoid sudden changes in water parameters.
- Ensure proper filtration and aeration.

## Conclusion

**Protomelas taeniolatus**, or the Red Empress, is a fantastic choice for aquarists looking to add vibrant colors and
activity to their aquarium. With proper care and maintenance, these fish will delight you with their beauty and
fascinating behavior for many years.
