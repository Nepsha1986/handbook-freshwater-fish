## Overview

**Pelvicachromis taeniatus**, commonly known as the Kribensis or Rainbow Cichlid, is a small, colorful cichlid native to West Africa. These fish are known for their striking coloration, with males exhibiting bright yellow, blue, and red hues, while females display a more subdued coloration with a prominent red belly. They typically grow to about 9-10 cm in length and have a lifespan of 5-8 years.

Kribensis are popular among aquarists due to their relatively peaceful nature and interesting behavior, especially during breeding. They can be kept in community tanks but should be housed with other peaceful species to prevent aggression.

## Tank Requirements

**Pelvicachromis taeniatus** prefer slightly acidic to neutral water conditions with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-20 dGH. The ideal temperature range is 24-28Â°C, and they should be kept in a tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters.

These fish thrive in well-planted aquariums with hiding spots created by rocks, caves, and dense vegetation. They enjoy a variety of substrates, but fine gravel or sand is preferred. Regular water changes are essential to maintain water quality and keep the Kribensis healthy.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Pelvicachromis taeniatus** feed on a diet of small invertebrates, crustaceans, and plant matter. In captivity, they will accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, pellets, frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia.

To ensure a balanced diet and promote vibrant coloration, offer a mix of protein-rich foods and vegetable-based options. Feed them small portions 2-3 times a day, taking care not to overfeed.

## Care and Maintenance

Kribensis are relatively easy to care for but are sensitive to poor water quality. Regular water changes of 20-30% each week are important to maintain a healthy environment. A good filtration system is necessary to keep the water clean and oxygenated.

These fish can be somewhat territorial, especially during breeding, so providing plenty of hiding places and territories will help reduce aggression and stress in the tank.

## Compatibility

**Pelvicachromis taeniatus** are generally peaceful but can display territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They can be kept with other small, peaceful fish such as tetras, rasboras, and Corydoras catfish. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species, as they may become stressed or bullied.

Keeping them in pairs or small groups will help promote their natural behavior and reduce aggression. Providing sufficient space and hiding spots is essential for their well-being.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pelvicachromis taeniatus** is relatively straightforward and can be accomplished in a community aquarium or a dedicated breeding tank. To encourage breeding, provide a flat surface or spawning cave where the female can lay her eggs.

The female will guard the eggs and care for the fry once they hatch. The fry can be fed on infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp. After a few weeks, the fry can be moved to a separate tank for growing out.
