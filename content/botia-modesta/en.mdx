## Overview

The Blue Botia (_Botia modesta_), also known as the Modest Loach, is a striking, semi-aggressive loach species from the
Botiidae family. Native to the rivers and floodplains of Southeast Asia, it has a beautiful blue body with vibrant red
fins. Due to its active nature and territorial behavior, it requires a spacious tank and does well in groups of similar
size.

## Tank Requirements

Blue Botias need a tank of at least 150 liters, with water temperatures between 24-28Â°C, pH levels of 6.5-7.5, and GH of
5-12. They prefer well-aerated water with a gentle to moderate current and appreciate hiding places created with rocks,
driftwood, or PVC tubes. A soft substrate is recommended, as these loaches may dig.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Blue Botias feed on small invertebrates and other live foods. In the aquarium, they accept a wide range of
foods, including sinking pellets, frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and vegetables. A varied diet with high-quality
proteins is essential for maintaining their vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Blue Botias are sensitive to water quality, so regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended. They enjoy tanks
with stable conditions and benefit from frequent observation to catch any early signs of disease. Ensure good filtration
and aeration, as they prefer oxygen-rich environments.

## Compatibility

Blue Botias are best kept with similar-sized, semi-aggressive species. They may nip at smaller, slower-moving fish, so
avoid keeping them with delicate tank mates. Ideal companions include larger barbs, peaceful cichlids, and other robust
species. They are social fish and should be kept in groups of at least five.

## Breeding

Breeding Blue Botias in captivity is challenging and rarely successful in home aquariums. They require specific water
conditions and large spaces to trigger spawning behaviors. While egg-scattering is observed in the wild, controlled
breeding in tanks remains largely undocumented.
