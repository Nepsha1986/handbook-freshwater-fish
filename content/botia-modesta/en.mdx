## Overview

Blue Botia (_Botia modesta_) is a large fish from the Botiidae family, native to the rivers of Southeast Asia, including
Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. Adults can reach up to 25 cm in length, making them one of the largest species in their
genus. Blue Botia is known for its vibrant blue or teal coloration, which becomes especially bright under proper care.
This fish prefers to live in groups and requires a spacious aquarium with plenty of hiding spots. Blue Botia is suitable
for experienced aquarists, as it requires stable conditions and careful maintenance.

The main feature of Blue Botia is its bright coloration: the body has a rich blue or teal hue, which can vary depending
on the conditions. This species is also known for its activity and curiosity, making it interesting to observe. Blue
Botia are schooling fish, and they should be kept in groups of 5–6 individuals to ensure their comfort.

### What Makes This Species Unique

- **Vibrant Blue Coloration**: The rich blue or teal color makes this fish one of the most beautiful in its family.
- **Large Size**: Blue Botia can grow up to 25 cm, making it suitable for spacious aquariums.
- **Active Nature**: These fish love to explore the aquarium and often interact with each other, making their behavior
  fascinating to watch.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females

Distinguishing males from females in Blue Botia is quite difficult, as sexual dimorphism is not pronounced. However,
there are a few signs:

**Main differences**:

- Females are usually larger and have a rounder belly, especially during the spawning period.
- Males are slimmer and may be slightly more brightly colored.
- Males are more active in hierarchical games.

These signs will help you distinguish the sexes, but accurate determination requires experience and careful observation.

## Care and Maintenance

Blue Botia requires stable conditions and careful maintenance. The aquarium should have a volume of at least 300 liters,
as the fish are large and prefer to live in groups. Water parameters should be as follows: temperature 24–28°C, pH
6.0–7.5, hardness 5–12 dGH. Regular water changes (20–25% of the volume weekly) will help maintain cleanliness.

For comfortable keeping of Blue Botia, the following are necessary:

- **Filtration and Aeration**: The fish are sensitive to water quality, so a powerful filter and good aeration are
  essential.
- **Substrate**: Use soft sand or fine gravel to avoid damaging their sensitive barbels.
- **Hiding Spots**: Driftwood, rocks, and caves are necessary to create a comfortable environment.

Blue Botia are peaceful but may display territorial behavior within their group. They get along well with other
non-aggressive species, such as large tetras, gouramis, and catfish.

## Diet and Nutrition

Blue Botia is an omnivorous fish. In the wild, it feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant matter. In the
aquarium, the diet should be varied:

- **Live and Frozen Foods**: Bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia.
- **Dry Foods**: High-quality pellets and flakes for bottom-dwelling fish.
- **Plant-Based Foods**: Blanched vegetables (cucumber, zucchini) and foods with plant components.

Feed 1–2 times a day in small portions. A fasting day can be arranged once a week.

## Compatibility with Other Species

Blue Botia is a peaceful fish that gets along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tankmates include:

- Large tetras
- Gouramis
- Catfish (e.g., plecos)
- Large rasboras

Avoid keeping them with small or slow-moving fish, as Botias may accidentally injure them. Also, be cautious with small
shrimp, as they may be perceived as prey.

## Breeding in the Aquarium

Breeding Blue Botia in a home aquarium is extremely difficult. In the wild, they spawn in rivers with fast currents,
which is hard to replicate in an aquarium. To stimulate spawning, the following are required:

- A separate spawning tank with a volume of at least 400 liters.
- Soft water (hardness up to 6 dGH) with a temperature of 26–28°C.
- Strong current and dim lighting.

After spawning, the parents should be removed, as they may eat the eggs. The fry hatch within 24–48 hours and begin
swimming after 3–4 days. Feed them infusoria and brine shrimp nauplii.
