## Overview

**Melanochromis johannii**, commonly referred to as the _Electric Blue Johanni Cichlid_, is a stunning Mbuna species
endemic to Lake Malawi in Africa. Its bold coloration and active behavior make it a favorite among cichlid enthusiasts,
although it requires specific care due to its territorial nature.

## Tank Requirements

This cichlid thrives in aquariums of at least 150 liters, with alkaline water and a pH between 7.5 and 8.5. Temperatures
should range from 24 to 28Â°C. Use plenty of rocks and caves to provide hiding spots and establish territories, while
also leaving open swimming areas.

## Feeding and Diet

Melanochromis johannii is an omnivore with a preference for herbivorous diets. Feed them high-quality vegetable-based
pellets, spirulina flakes, and occasional protein sources like brine shrimp or bloodworms. Avoid overfeeding with
protein-rich foods, as it can lead to digestive issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining stable water conditions and a clean environment is essential for this species. Regular water changes and
efficient filtration are required to handle their bioload. They are territorial and may exhibit aggression, particularly
during breeding or when space is limited.

## Compatibility

Due to their territorial nature, Electric Blue Johanni Cichlids are best kept with other Mbuna species that can hold
their own. Avoid housing them with overly passive fish or those of similar coloration, as this can trigger aggression.
Keeping them in a species-specific tank or with compatible cichlids is ideal.

## Breeding

Breeding Melanochromis johannii is relatively straightforward. They are maternal mouthbrooders, with females carrying
fertilized eggs in their mouths until the fry hatch. To encourage spawning, maintain ideal water conditions and provide
caves or flat surfaces for courtship.
