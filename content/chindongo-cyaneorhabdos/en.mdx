## Overview

**Chindongo cyaneorhabdos**, also known as _Pseudotropheus cyaneorhabdos_ or the Maingano Cichlid, is a small,
strikingly colored Mbuna species endemic to Lake Malawi. Its vivid blue and black horizontal stripes make it a favorite
among cichlid enthusiasts.

## Tank Requirements

This species thrives in a tank of at least 150 liters, with plenty of rocks and caves to provide territories and hiding
spots. Water should be maintained at 24-28Â°C, with a pH between 7.8-8.6 and hardness of 10-20 dGH. The tank setup should
mimic their rocky lake habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Chindongo cyaneorhabdos are primarily herbivores and should be fed a diet rich in spirulina-based flakes or pellets,
along with fresh vegetables like spinach or zucchini. Avoid high-protein foods, as these can cause health issues.

## Care and Maintenance

These cichlids require clean, well-oxygenated water. Regular water changes and efficient filtration are crucial for
maintaining water quality. Their territorial nature means tankmates should be chosen carefully.

## Compatibility

Maingano Cichlids are territorial and moderately aggressive, particularly during breeding. They can coexist with other
Mbuna cichlids of similar size and temperament, but avoid pairing them with timid or slow-moving fish.

## Breeding

Chindongo cyaneorhabdos are maternal mouthbrooders. Females carry the eggs and fry in their mouths for about 21-28 days.
To encourage breeding, maintain stable water parameters and provide plenty of flat rocks or caves for spawning. Fry can
be fed finely crushed flakes or baby brine shrimp.
