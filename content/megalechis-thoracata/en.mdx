## Overview

The Spotted Hoplo Catfish (_Megalechis thoracata_), also known as the Armored Catfish, is a hardy bottom-dwelling fish
from the Callichthyidae family. Native to South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, this catfish is known for its
armored appearance and distinctive spotted pattern. It is a peaceful and resilient species, making it a popular choice
for community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

This catfish requires a minimum tank size of 100 liters, with a temperature range of 20-26Â°C, pH of 6.0-8.0, and GH of
5-15. A sandy substrate is recommended to prevent damage to their barbels, and they appreciate a well-structured tank
with hiding spots like driftwood, rocks, and caves. Moderate lighting and open swimming areas will help mimic their
natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is an omnivore that feeds on detritus, small invertebrates, and plant matter in the wild. In
an aquarium, they readily accept sinking pellets, algae wafers, and occasional treats of live or frozen foods like
bloodworms and brine shrimp. Their diet should be varied to ensure optimal health.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary to maintain water quality. This species is generally hardy but
requires stable water conditions to thrive. As nocturnal feeders, it is best to feed them just before lights go off.

## Compatibility

The Spotted Hoplo Catfish is peaceful and compatible with a variety of tank mates, including other non-aggressive fish.
They do well in groups of three or more and can be kept with other bottom-dwellers, provided the tank has sufficient
space.

## Breeding

Breeding Spotted Hoplo Catfish in captivity is achievable with the right setup. Males build bubble nests where the
female deposits eggs, which the male guards. To encourage breeding, slightly increase the water temperature and add
floating plants. After the eggs hatch, feed the fry with infusoria or finely crushed flakes.
