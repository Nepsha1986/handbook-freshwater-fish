## Overview

**Telmatherina ladigesi**, commonly known as the Celebes Rainbowfish or Ladiges Rainbowfish, is a small, colorful
freshwater fish belonging to the family Melanotaeniidae. This species is native to the streams and lakes of Sulawesi,
Indonesia, where it inhabits clear, slow-moving waters. Celebes Rainbowfish are admired for their vibrant, iridescent
bodies that shimmer in hues of blue, green, and yellow, making them a popular choice among aquarists. They have a
slender body shape with distinctively elongated fins and are known for their peaceful temperament, making them suitable
for community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Celebes Rainbowfish thrive in a well-maintained aquarium of at least 70 liters (about 18 gallons). The ideal water
temperature should be kept between 24-28°C (75-82°F), with a pH range of 7.0-8.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 8-15.
These fish prefer a well-planted tank with plenty of swimming space and a gentle water current to mimic their natural
habitat. Adding floating plants can help diffuse light and provide shelter. A good filtration system is essential to
maintain high water quality, as these fish are sensitive to poor water conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Telmatherina ladigesi** primarily feeds on small insects, crustaceans, and zooplankton. In an aquarium
setting, they should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality flakes or pellets designed for small,
omnivorous fish. Supplement their diet with live or frozen foods such as daphnia, brine shrimp, and bloodworms to
enhance their coloration and maintain their health. Feeding them small amounts 2-3 times daily is recommended to ensure
they receive adequate nutrition without overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Celebes Rainbowfish requires regular tank maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-30% to maintain
optimal water quality. Ensure the tank is equipped with a good filtration system to keep the water clean and oxygenated.
Monitor water parameters regularly to prevent any fluctuations that could stress the fish. Regularly check for signs of
illness or stress, such as changes in coloration, clamped fins, or erratic swimming behavior, and address any issues
promptly.

## Compatibility

Celebes Rainbowfish are generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive species that share similar
water parameter requirements. Ideal tank mates include other small rainbowfish, tetras, rasboras, and Corydoras catfish.
Avoid housing them with large, aggressive fish that may bully or outcompete them for food. Keeping Celebes Rainbowfish
in small groups of at least 5-6 individuals can help reduce stress and encourage natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding **Telmatherina ladigesi** in captivity is possible but requires attention to detail. These fish are egg
scatterers and typically spawn among fine-leaved plants or spawning mops. To encourage breeding, provide a separate
breeding tank with slightly warmer water (around 26-28°C) and plenty of plants or spawning media. Once spawning occurs,
the eggs will stick to the plants, and the parents should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs
typically hatch within 7-10 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough
to consume larger foods.
