## Overview

Laubuka dadiburjori, commonly known as the Indian Neon or Bengal Danio, is a small, delicate fish native to freshwater
rivers and streams in India and Bangladesh. Their iridescent, shimmering bodies give them a striking appearance, making
them a popular choice for planted community aquariums. With their peaceful nature, they thrive in groups, displaying
schooling behavior.

## Tank Requirements

These small fish are best kept in a well-planted aquarium of at least 40 liters. The water temperature should be
maintained between 22-28Â°C, with a pH level of 6.0-7.5 and a water hardness of 5-15 dGH. A soft substrate, such as fine
gravel or sand, along with some plants, driftwood, and hiding places, will help mimic their natural habitat. A gentle
flow of water is ideal to simulate the river environments they come from.

## Feeding and Diet

Laubuka dadiburjori are omnivores in the wild, feeding on small invertebrates, algae, and plant matter. In the aquarium,
they should be fed a mix of high-quality flakes or micro-pellets, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine
shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. It's important to feed them small particles due to their tiny mouths.

## Care and Maintenance

These fish are relatively easy to care for but do require regular maintenance. Weekly water changes and monitoring of
water parameters will help maintain their health. Keep an eye on their behavior to ensure they are active and schooling,
as this is a sign of good health. Regular cleaning of the tank and filter will help maintain water quality.

## Compatibility

Indian Neons are peaceful and should be kept in a group of at least 6-8 individuals. They do well in community tanks
with other peaceful fish such as small tetras, rasboras, and dwarf shrimp. However, avoid larger, aggressive species
that may see them as prey due to their small size.

## Breeding

Breeding Laubuka dadiburjori can be achieved in captivity, though it requires some attention to detail. These fish are
egg scatterers and prefer a heavily planted breeding tank with soft water. Once the eggs are laid, remove the adults to
prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch within 1-2 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely
crushed flake food.
