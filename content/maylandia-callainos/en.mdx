## Overview

The Cobalt Zebra Cichlid (_Maylandia callainos_), also known as the Blue Cobalt Cichlid, is a popular species among
African cichlid enthusiasts. Native to the rocky shores of Lake Malawi, this fish is known for its vibrant cobalt blue
coloration and lively, territorial nature. While somewhat aggressive, its stunning appearance and active behavior make
it a favorite in aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 150 liters is recommended for Cobalt Zebra Cichlids. They thrive in warm water temperatures
between 24-28Â°C, a pH of 7.8-8.6, and water with moderate to high hardness (GH 10-20). A sandy substrate with plenty of
rocks and caves is ideal, as it allows the fish to establish territories. Robust filtration and regular water changes
are essential for maintaining water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

Cobalt Zebras are omnivorous, with a preference for a diet rich in plant matter. Offer them high-quality cichlid
pellets, spirulina-based foods, and vegetable matter such as blanched spinach or peas. Supplementing their diet with
occasional protein-based foods, like brine shrimp or bloodworms, can be beneficial but should be done sparingly to avoid
digestive issues.

## Care and Maintenance

These cichlids require regular tank maintenance to keep them healthy. Weekly water changes of 20-30% and consistent
monitoring of water parameters are essential. They are prone to Malawi bloat, a condition that can be prevented by
avoiding excessive protein in their diet and maintaining stable water conditions.

## Compatibility

Cobalt Zebras can be aggressive, especially towards other cichlids of similar size and color. They are best kept with
other robust African cichlids that can handle their assertive nature. Avoid keeping them with docile or delicate
species, as they may bully or outcompete them for space.

## Breeding

Breeding _Maylandia callainos_ is relatively straightforward in a well-maintained aquarium. They are maternal
mouthbrooders, meaning females carry eggs and fry in their mouths until they are ready to swim freely. Provide hiding
spaces for the female during this time, as males can be persistent. Raising fry in a separate tank can improve survival
rates.
