## Overview

**Carinotetraodon travancoricus**, commonly referred to as the Dwarf Pufferfish or Pea Puffer, is a tiny freshwater
species native to the rivers of the Western Ghats in India. Despite their small size, typically reaching only 2-3 cm in
length, they have big personalities and are highly active and inquisitive fish.

Living 5 to 7 years in captivity, the Dwarf Pufferfish is a popular choice among aquarists who enjoy species with
distinct behaviors. They are known for their playful yet sometimes aggressive nature, making them a fascinating addition
to a community tank, provided they are kept with compatible species.

## Tank Requirements

Although **Carinotetraodon travancoricus** is small, they need ample space to swim and explore. A minimum tank size of
40 liters is recommended. They thrive in water temperatures between 24-28°C with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and
a pH range of 6.5-7.5.

The tank should include plenty of hiding spots and decorations such as live plants, caves, and driftwood to keep them
stimulated and reduce stress. This environment helps them exhibit natural behaviors, like hunting small invertebrates
and interacting with their surroundings.

## Feeding and Diet

Dwarf Pufferfish are primarily carnivorous and require a protein-rich diet. They enjoy live or frozen foods, such as
bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small snails, which they may hunt and eat in the tank. Crushing snail shells helps
maintain their beaks, which can otherwise grow too long.

It’s important to feed them small portions multiple times a day, as they have high metabolisms. Avoid overfeeding to
maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

**Carinotetraodon travancoricus** requires regular care to keep their environment healthy. Weekly water changes of
25-30% are essential to maintain good water conditions and prevent the buildup of harmful substances like ammonia and
nitrates.

Monitoring water parameters is important to keep this sensitive species healthy. Dwarf Puffers can be susceptible to
poor water quality, so ensuring a well-filtered, clean tank is key to their wellbeing.

## Compatibility

While Dwarf Puffers are small, they can exhibit territorial and aggressive behavior, especially towards other fish that
are similar in size or slower-moving. It’s best to keep them either in a species-only tank or with fast-moving, peaceful
tank mates like certain rasboras or danios.

Avoid housing them with larger, more aggressive fish or species that may outcompete them for food. Adding plenty of
hiding places will help reduce aggression and provide space for each fish to establish its own territory.

## Breeding

Breeding **Carinotetraodon travancoricus** in captivity is possible but challenging. They require specific conditions,
including densely planted tanks to create a natural breeding environment. Males will often display bright coloration and
court females by performing various displays.

After spawning, eggs are typically laid on plants or other surfaces and will hatch in 4-5 days. Fry are very small and
delicate, requiring infusoria or other microscopic foods until they grow larger.
