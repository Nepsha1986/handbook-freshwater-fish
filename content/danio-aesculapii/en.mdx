## Overview

Danio aesculapii, commonly known as the Aesculapius Danio, is a colorful and lively freshwater fish native to the rivers
of Southeast Asia. This species is appreciated for its vibrant appearance, characterized by its striking vertical
stripes and active nature. It is an excellent addition to community tanks and does well in groups.

## Tank Requirements

Danio aesculapii requires a tank of at least 50 liters. They prefer a water temperature between 22-28Â°C, with a pH range
of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (dGH) of 5-12. Providing a well-planted tank with plenty of open swimming space is
important, as these fish are very active. Moderate water flow and a good filtration system will help maintain their
health and vibrant coloration.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Danio aesculapii feeds on small insects and aquatic invertebrates. In an aquarium setting, they are
omnivorous and can be fed a varied diet including high-quality flakes, micro pellets, and live or frozen foods such as
brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. A balanced diet supports their health and enhances their colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio aesculapii is relatively easy to care for, making it suitable for both beginner and experienced aquarists. Regular
water changes and monitoring of water quality are essential to keep these fish healthy. Due to their active nature, a
well-maintained tank with stable water conditions is crucial for their well-being.

## Compatibility

Aesculapius Danios are peaceful fish that can be kept with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tank mates include small
tetras, rasboras, and other danios. They should be kept in groups of at least 6 to reduce stress and encourage natural
schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio aesculapii in captivity is achievable with proper conditions. They are egg scatterers, so providing a
breeding tank with fine-leaved plants will help increase the chances of successful spawning. After spawning, remove the
adults to protect the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or liquid
fry food.
