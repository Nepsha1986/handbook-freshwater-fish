## Overview

**Corydoras pygmaeus**, commonly referred to as the Pygmy Corydoras, is a small freshwater catfish native to the Amazon
Basin in South America. This species typically grows to a size of 3-4 cm and has a lifespan of 3 to 5 years.

These tiny catfish are known for their friendly and social nature, often found swimming in small groups. Their playful
behavior and unique appearance make them popular choices among aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

**Corydoras pygmaeus** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general hardness
(GH) between 2-12 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 22-26Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 60 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with sandy substrate is ideal for these fish, as they love to forage for food among the
substrate. Providing plenty of hiding spots and open swimming space will keep them happy and healthy.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Corydoras pygmaeus** are omnivorous and primarily feed on small invertebrates, detritus, and plant
matter. In captivity, they readily accept high-quality sinking pellets, flakes, and frozen or live foods such as brine
shrimp and bloodworms.

To ensure their health and well-being, it is essential to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and
vegetable-based foods. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, with portions they can consume within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining optimal water conditions is crucial for **Corydoras pygmaeus**. Regular water changes of 20-30% per week are
recommended to keep the water clean and stable. A reliable filtration system is essential for maintaining good water
quality.

These fish prefer a well-oxygenated environment, so providing adequate aeration through a sponge filter or air stones
can be beneficial. Monitoring water parameters closely will help prevent stress and disease.

## Compatibility

**Corydoras pygmaeus** are peaceful fish that can be kept with various community tankmates. Suitable companions include
small tetras, rasboras, and other peaceful species that share similar water requirements.

Avoid keeping them with aggressive or large fish, as they may be bullied or outcompeted for food. Ensuring a spacious
environment with plenty of hiding spots will help reduce stress and aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Corydoras pygmaeus** in captivity can be rewarding but requires some preparation. They are egg layers and
typically spawn on flat surfaces in the aquarium.

Setting up a breeding tank with gentle filtration and plenty of hiding places will encourage spawning behavior. Once the
eggs are laid, they should be removed to prevent them from being eaten by the parents. Fry can be fed infusoria or
finely crushed flakes once they are free-swimming.
