## Overview

Ctenopoma acutirostre, commonly known as the Leopard Bushfish or Spotted Climbing Perch, is a freshwater fish native to
the Congo River Basin in Central Africa. Recognized for its distinct leopard-like spots and stealthy nature, this
species can be a captivating addition to a well-maintained aquarium. Leopard Bushfish are nocturnal hunters, often
hiding among dense vegetation during the day and becoming more active at night. They possess a labyrinth organ that
allows them to breathe atmospheric air, making them more adaptable to varying water conditions.

## Tank Requirements

Leopard Bushfish require a spacious aquarium with a minimum size of 200 liters. The ideal water temperature for this
species is between 24-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-20 dGH. A tank with plenty of
hiding places, such as caves, driftwood, and dense plants, is essential to mimic their natural habitat and reduce
stress. They prefer subdued lighting to simulate the dimly lit conditions of their native environments. Regular water
changes and good filtration are crucial to maintain water quality, as Leopard Bushfish are sensitive to poor conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

Ctenopoma acutirostre is an opportunistic predator that feeds on small fish, insects, and crustaceans in the wild. In an
aquarium setting, they should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality pellets, frozen or live foods
such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small feeder fish. It's important to avoid overfeeding, as they have a tendency to
eat more than necessary. Feeding them once a day, preferably in the evening when they are most active, is recommended.

## Care and Maintenance

Leopard Bushfish are relatively hardy but require stable water conditions and a well-maintained environment. Weekly
water changes of about 25-30% are necessary to maintain good water quality. Regular monitoring of water parameters is
also essential to ensure they remain within the ideal range. The tank should be covered, as these fish can jump if
startled. It's important to provide a stress-free environment with plenty of hiding places to keep them comfortable.

## Compatibility

Ctenopoma acutirostre is semi-aggressive and should be kept with tank mates of similar size and temperament. They are
best housed with other larger, non-aggressive fish such as larger tetras, cichlids, or catfish. Avoid keeping them with
small, slow-moving fish or invertebrates, as they may be seen as prey. It is also advisable to avoid keeping multiple
Leopard Bushfish together unless the tank is large enough to provide ample territory for each individual.

## Breeding

Breeding Leopard Bushfish in captivity is challenging due to their specific requirements and aggressive nature during
breeding. To encourage breeding, a separate breeding tank with soft, acidic water (pH around 6.0-6.5) and a temperature
of 26-28°C is recommended. The tank should have plenty of hiding spots and floating plants. During courtship, the male
will display intense color and perform a dance to attract the female. After spawning, the eggs are usually scattered
among plants. It is important to remove the adults after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will
hatch in about 3-4 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food until they are large enough to
accept baby brine shrimp.
