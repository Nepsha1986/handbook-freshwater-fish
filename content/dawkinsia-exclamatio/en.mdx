## Overview

**Dawkinsia exclamatio**, or Exclamation Barb, is a striking fish species native to the Western Ghats of India. Known
for its unique patterning, resembling an exclamation mark, this species thrives in well-maintained community tanks. It
is a peaceful schooling fish and requires the company of its own kind to feel secure.

## Tank Requirements

Exclamation Barb requires a minimum aquarium size of 100 liters (26 gallons) with moderate water flow and stable
parameters. The ideal water temperature ranges from 22-26°C (72-79°F), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5, and general
hardness (GH) of 5-15. A well-planted tank with open swimming spaces and driftwood would provide a natural environment
for this species.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Dawkinsia exclamatio** feeds on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In captivity, they accept a
variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, pellets, and live or frozen foods such as daphnia, bloodworms, and
brine shrimp. A balanced diet with occasional vegetable matter will ensure their well-being.

## Care and Maintenance

Exclamation Barbs are relatively easy to care for, provided that regular water changes and proper filtration are
maintained. They are active swimmers, so they benefit from a spacious aquarium. It is recommended to keep them in groups
of at least six to promote natural schooling behavior and reduce stress.

## Compatibility

These peaceful fish are best suited for community tanks with other peaceful species like tetras, rasboras, and small
catfish. Avoid keeping them with aggressive or much larger species that might bully or prey on them.

## Breeding

Breeding **Dawkinsia exclamatio** in captivity is achievable but can be a challenge. They are egg scatterers, and their
breeding behavior can be triggered by increased temperature and water flow. Spawning typically occurs in the early
morning, and once the eggs are laid, the adults should be removed to prevent egg predation. The eggs will hatch in 24-36
hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flakes.
