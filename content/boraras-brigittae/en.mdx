## Overview

_Boraras brigittae_, commonly known as the Chili Rasbora, is a small and colorful fish native to the slow-moving waters
of Southeast Asia, including parts of Borneo and Sumatra. This species is popular among aquarists for its vibrant red
and orange coloration, which stands out in a well-planted aquarium. Chili Rasboras are known for their peaceful behavior
and small size, making them ideal for nano tanks and community setups.

## Tank Requirements

Chili Rasboras do well in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 30 liters. They prefer a temperature range
of 22-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand or fine gravel, and
be decorated with live plants and gentle water flow to mimic their natural habitat. A good filtration system is
important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Boraras brigittae_ is an omnivorous species that primarily feeds on small live or frozen foods in the wild, such as
micro-worms and tiny insects. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of high-quality small pellets, flakes, and occasional
live or frozen foods like daphnia and brine shrimp. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance
their coloration. Feed them once or twice a day, with portions suitable to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Chili Rasboras involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are
relatively easy to care for and make a great addition to small or community tanks due to their peaceful nature. Regular
water changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as fin rot or ich.
Their small size and peaceful temperament make them suitable for tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.

## Compatibility

_Boraras brigittae_ is a peaceful and social fish that prefers to be kept in schools of at least 6-10 individuals. They
are best kept with other small, non-aggressive fish that can tolerate similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates
include other small rasboras, tetras, and dwarf shrimp. Avoid housing them with larger or more aggressive species, as
they may become stressed or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Boraras brigittae_ in captivity can be achieved with the right setup. They are egg-scattering fish, and
breeding can be encouraged by providing a well-planted tank with plenty of hiding spots. To promote breeding, maintain a
temperature around 26-28°C and offer a varied diet to the breeding pair. The female will scatter eggs among the plants,
which will hatch in about 24-36 hours. The fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming.
Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy fry.
