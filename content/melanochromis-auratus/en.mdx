## Overview

**Melanochromis auratus**, commonly known as **Golden Mbuna** or **Auratus Cichlid**, is a strikingly vibrant freshwater
fish from Lake Malawi. They are known for their bright yellow bodies with bold black stripes and a distinctly
territorial nature. Growing to a length of 10-12 cm and living up to 5-7 years, this cichlid is a popular choice for
experienced aquarists due to its aggressive behavior and need for specific water conditions.

## Tank Requirements

**Golden Mbuna** requires an aquarium of at least 150 liters with a temperature range of 24-28°C, a pH between 7.5 and
8.5, and a water hardness (GH) of 10-20. The tank should have plenty of rocks and caves to mimic their natural rocky
habitat and provide hiding spots to reduce territorial aggression. A sandy substrate is preferred, and a good filtration
system is necessary to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Melanochromis auratus** feeds on algae and small invertebrates. In captivity, they should be given a
varied diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, spirulina-based foods, and occasional live or frozen foods like
brine shrimp. Be cautious not to overfeed and maintain a regular feeding schedule.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes of 20-30% every week are necessary to maintain water quality and prevent stress in **Golden
Mbuna**. Due to their aggressive nature, keeping them in a well-maintained tank with stable water parameters is crucial.
They are prone to territorial disputes, so providing enough space and hiding spots is important to minimize conflicts.

## Compatibility

**Melanochromis auratus** is known for its aggressive and territorial behavior, particularly towards fish of similar
size and coloration. It’s best to house them with other similarly aggressive mbuna species from Lake Malawi. Avoid
keeping them with peaceful or smaller fish, as they may be bullied or attacked. A large tank with plenty of hiding spots
helps manage aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Golden Mbuna** in captivity is relatively straightforward. These mouthbrooders are known for their unique
breeding behavior, where the female holds the fertilized eggs in her mouth until they hatch. To encourage breeding,
provide clean water and a varied diet. The fry can be fed crushed cichlid pellets or specialized fry food once they are
free-swimming.
