## Overview

**Epiplatys annulatus**, commonly known as the Clown Killifish or Banded Panchax, is a small and peaceful species native
to slow-moving waters of West Africa. It is known for its vibrant coloration, featuring a mix of vertical black and
golden stripes on its body, with bright red and blue markings on the tail. Growing to a size of around 3-4 cm, these
fish are perfect for nano aquariums.

This species is quite hardy and easy to care for, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced aquarists. They
have a lifespan of around 3-4 years and are generally active during the day, though they prefer calmer tank
environments.

## Tank Requirements

**Epiplatys annulatus** thrives in smaller aquariums with a volume of 20 liters or more. The water temperature should be
maintained between 22-26°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-15. A heavily planted aquarium
with floating plants will help provide them with shade and replicate their natural habitat. They prefer slow-moving
water, so avoid strong filtration systems.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Epiplatys annulatus** feeds on small insects, larvae, and other tiny invertebrates. In an aquarium
setting, they will accept a variety of foods, including high-quality micro-pellets, brine shrimp, daphnia, and mosquito
larvae. They may also enjoy occasional treats of live or frozen foods. Feeding them a varied diet will ensure they
maintain their bright coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

**Epiplatys annulatus** is generally a hardy species, but they require stable water conditions to thrive. Regular water
changes are necessary, and the water should be kept clean with a gentle filter. Given their small size, they are
sensitive to sudden water parameter changes, so it’s essential to maintain stability. They do best in peaceful community
tanks with similarly small and calm species.

## Compatibility

Clown Killifish are peaceful and should be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish such as small tetras, dwarf
shrimp, and pygmy corydoras. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species that may view them as prey. They can
be kept in pairs or small groups, but ensure enough hiding spots to minimize stress.

## Breeding

Breeding **Epiplatys annulatus** is relatively easy in a well-maintained aquarium. They are egg-layers, and the females
will deposit eggs on fine-leaved plants or moss. The eggs typically hatch within 10-14 days. Fry should be fed with
microfoods like infusoria and gradually introduced to baby brine shrimp as they grow. It’s essential to separate the fry
from adult fish to prevent predation.
