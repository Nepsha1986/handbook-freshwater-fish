## Overview

The White Cloud Mountain Minnow (Tanichthys albonubes) is a small, peaceful fish from the Cyprinidae family, native to
the streams of southern China. This hardy species, which grows to about 3-4 cm, is popular among aquarists for its ease
of care and adaptability to a variety of water conditions. The White Cloud Mountain Minnow has a striking appearance,
with a silver-green body, a red tail, and iridescent horizontal stripes. It’s an ideal fish for beginner aquarists and
does well in cooler water temperatures.

## Tank Requirements

White Cloud Mountain Minnows thrive in small community tanks of at least 60 liters. They prefer cooler water
temperatures ranging from 16-22°C, making them suitable for unheated aquariums. The pH should be maintained between
6.0-8.0, with a water hardness (GH) of 5-19. A well-planted tank with open swimming areas is ideal, and they enjoy a
moderate water current to mimic their natural stream habitat. Fine gravel or sand substrates work well for this species,
and gentle filtration is recommended to keep the water clean without creating too much turbulence.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, White Cloud Mountain Minnows feed on small insects, larvae, and plant matter. In the aquarium, they are
easy to feed and will accept a wide range of foods, including high-quality flakes, micro pellets, and live or frozen
foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia. They are active feeders and should be fed small amounts several times a day.
Their diet should be varied to ensure they receive all necessary nutrients for optimal health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for White Cloud Mountain Minnows is straightforward, making them an excellent choice for beginners. Regular water
changes of 20-25% weekly are recommended to maintain water quality. They are a hardy species but thrive best in stable
water conditions. Watch for any signs of illness, such as changes in coloration or behavior, which could indicate poor
water quality or stress. Provide hiding spots using plants or decorations to help them feel secure.

## Compatibility

White Cloud Mountain Minnows are peaceful and do well in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. They can be
kept with small tetras, rasboras, and other minnows. Due to their small size, they should not be housed with larger,
more aggressive fish that might see them as prey. They are schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least six
to display their natural schooling behavior and reduce stress.

## Breeding

Breeding White Cloud Mountain Minnows is relatively easy and can be done in the main tank or a separate breeding tank.
They are egg scatterers, and females will lay eggs among plants or fine-leaved spawning mops. After spawning, the adults
should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-48 hours, and the fry can be
fed infusoria or commercially prepared fry foods until they are large enough to eat finely crushed flakes or micro
worms.
