## Overview

The Chinese Hillstream Loach (_Beaufortia kweichowensis_), part of the Gastromyzontidae family, is native to
fast-flowing rivers in China. This small, peaceful fish has a distinct flat body, helping it to cling to rocks in strong
currents. It is well-known for its algae-eating habits and is popular in aquariums with high water flow.

## Tank Requirements

The Chinese Hillstream Loach requires a minimum tank size of 80 liters. Water temperature should be between 20-24Â°C,
with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and moderate hardness (GH 8-15). The tank should simulate river conditions with high water flow and
oxygenation, ideally with smooth rocks and areas for grazing on algae.

## Feeding and Diet

This loach is an omnivore, primarily feeding on algae and biofilm. In an aquarium, it can be given algae wafers,
blanched vegetables, and other small sinking foods. A diet rich in plant matter is essential for its well-being.

## Care and Maintenance

Good water quality and high oxygen levels are essential for the Chinese Hillstream Loach. Regular water changes and a
strong filtration system are recommended. The tank should mimic river-like conditions, with a substrate of smooth rocks
to prevent injury.

## Compatibility

The Chinese Hillstream Loach is peaceful and can coexist with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tank mates include
other hillstream loaches, small rasboras, and danios that prefer similar conditions.

## Breeding

Breeding Chinese Hillstream Loaches in captivity is challenging due to their specific environmental needs. They
typically spawn under rocks or crevices in the wild. Providing river-like flow and ample hiding places can encourage
natural breeding behavior, but success is rare in home aquariums.
