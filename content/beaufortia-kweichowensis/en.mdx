## Overview

_Beaufortia kweichowensis_ is a small hillstream loach from the family Gastromyzontidae, native to fast-flowing mountain
streams in Guizhou province, southern China. The body is flattened and disc-shaped, with broadly spread pectoral and
pelvic fins forming a powerful suction cup. This design allows the fish to cling firmly to rocks even in the strongest
currents — where most other fish could not survive.

The coloration is brownish-green with dark spots and bands, providing excellent camouflage on rocky bottoms. Adults
reach 5–7 cm and live 8–10 years — surprisingly long for a fish this size. The Hillstream Loach is active during the
day, constantly moving across rocks and aquarium glass in search of algae film. Watching its unusual locomotion is one
of the main joys of keeping this species.

## Tank Requirements

A small group of 3–4 fish can be housed in an aquarium from 80 liters. The key requirement is simulating a mountain
stream: strong current and high oxygen saturation. Water parameters: temperature 20–24°C (this is a cool-water
species!), pH 6.5–7.5, hardness GH 8–15. Temperatures above 25°C are dangerous — warm water holds less dissolved oxygen
and the fish will suffer.

Use rounded pebbles and smooth rocks of various sizes as substrate. Sharp edges are unacceptable — the loach presses its
body tightly against surfaces and can injure its belly. Create strong flow using a powerhead or by directing the filter
outlet. Provide medium to bright lighting to encourage algae growth on rocks, which serves as the primary food source.
Live plants are possible but choose species that tolerate current: Anubias and Bucephalandra on rocks, plus mosses like
Java moss or Flame moss.

## Feeding and Diet

_Beaufortia kweichowensis_ is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algal biofilm (Aufwuchs) that grows on rocks and other
surfaces. In a well-set-up aquarium with plenty of illuminated rocks, the fish can largely sustain itself on natural
food.

However, relying solely on natural algae is risky — supplement with sinking spirulina and algae wafers, blanched
zucchini, spinach, and cucumber. Occasionally offer frozen bloodworms or daphnia as a protein supplement. Feed in the
evening when competition for food is lower. Hillstream loaches are shy and may not get enough food when kept with more
active species.

## Care and Maintenance

Clean, cool, oxygen-rich water is the foundation of successful keeping. Weekly water changes of 25–30% are mandatory.
Filtration must provide not just cleaning but also strong flow — use an external canister filter or an additional
powerhead. Ammonia and nitrites must be strictly at zero, nitrates below 15 mg/l.

Temperature control is especially important in summer — if the room gets hot, you may need an aquarium chiller or
clip-on fans for cooling. Overheating is the main threat to this species. Do not use copper-based medications in the
tank — hillstream loaches are extremely sensitive to them. Keeping Beaufortia with heated tropical fish creates a
temperature conflict, so a dedicated biotope tank is the best approach.

## Compatibility

The Chinese Hillstream Loach is a peaceful fish. Ideal tankmates are other cool-water stream inhabitants:
[Stiphodon](/en/stiphodon-ornatus), small danios ([Zebra Danio](/en/danio-rerio),
[Celestial Pearl Danio](/en/danio-margaritatus)), and [Doctor Fish](/en/garra-rufa). The key requirement is that all
tankmates must prefer cool water and current.

Do not keep with tropical warm-water species — discus, angelfish, or gouramis. Their temperature requirements are
incompatible. Also avoid large or aggressive bottom-dwellers that will compete for territory. Among themselves,
Hillstream Loaches are peaceful but may show mild territoriality over favorite rocks — this is normal and does not cause
injury as long as there are enough surfaces.

## Breeding

Breeding _Beaufortia kweichowensis_ at home is difficult (difficulty 4 out of 5) and has been documented only in
isolated cases. In the wild, spawning reportedly occurs under rocks and in crevices in mountain streams. The exact
conditions needed to trigger spawning are poorly studied.

What is known is that successful breeding requires: a mature, established group of fish, abundant flow, plenty of rock
shelters, and excellent water quality. Seasonal temperature fluctuations and simulating a rainy period may serve as
triggers. Eggs are laid under rocks, and fry are tiny, feeding on microalgae. If you are interested in breeding
hillstream loaches, be patient and provide the most natural conditions possible — success is not guaranteed, but the
experience of observing these fish in a biotope aquarium is rewarding in itself.
