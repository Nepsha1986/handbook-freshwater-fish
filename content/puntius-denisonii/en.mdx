## Overview

**Puntius denisonii**, commonly referred to as Denison's Barb or Roja Fish, is a stunning freshwater fish native to the
rivers of India and Nepal. This species is known for its vibrant red and golden coloration, which makes it a popular
choice among aquarists. They typically reach a size of 6-7 cm and have a lifespan of 5 to 7 years.

These fish are peaceful and social, thriving in groups. Their active swimming behavior and striking appearance make them
an attractive addition to community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

**Puntius denisonii** prefer slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and a general hardness (GH)
of 5-15 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 22-28°C, and they should be kept in a tank with a
minimum volume of 100 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with plenty of open swimming space is essential for their well-being. Providing hiding spots
with driftwood or rock formations can help create a natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Puntius denisonii** primarily feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they accept a
variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, small pellets, and live or frozen foods such as daphnia, brine shrimp,
and bloodworms.

To keep them healthy and vibrant, offer a balanced diet that includes both protein-rich foods and plant matter. Feeding
should occur 2-3 times a day, ensuring they consume all food within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Denison's Barb is relatively easy to care for but requires good water quality. Regular water changes of 20-30% each week
are necessary to maintain a clean environment. A reliable filtration system is essential for keeping the water
well-oxygenated.

These fish should be kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals to promote their natural behavior and reduce stress.
They appreciate the company of their own kind and thrive in larger groups.

## Compatibility

**Puntius denisonii** are generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tankmates
include tetras, rasboras, and other barbs. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species, as this may cause
stress.

Providing plenty of swimming space and hiding spots will help maintain a harmonious environment for these active and
sociable fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Puntius denisonii** can be challenging and requires specific conditions. To encourage breeding, provide a
separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants for egg laying.

The female will scatter eggs among the plants, and they usually hatch within 24-48 hours. Once the fry are
free-swimming, they can be fed with finely crushed flakes or specialized fry food. It’s important to separate the fry
from adult fish to prevent them from being eaten.
