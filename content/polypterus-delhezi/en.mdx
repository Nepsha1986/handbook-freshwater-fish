## Overview

Polypterus delhezi, commonly known as the Armoured Bichir, is a species of bichir native to the slow-moving rivers and
swamps of Central and West Africa. This fascinating fish belongs to the family Polypteridae and is recognized by its
distinctive striped pattern and elongated body. Polypterus delhezi can grow up to 35-40 cm in length and has a lifespan
of 15-20 years when kept in optimal conditions. Its prehistoric appearance, coupled with its nocturnal behavior, makes
it a popular choice among experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Polypterus delhezi requires a large tank of at least 300 liters due to its size and active nature. The water temperature
should be maintained between 24-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-20. A soft
substrate like sand or fine gravel is recommended, along with plenty of hiding spots such as caves, driftwood, and dense
vegetation. The tank should be securely covered to prevent the fish from escaping, as Polypterus delhezi is known for
its ability to jump. Dim lighting is preferred, mimicking its natural habitat in murky waters.

## Feeding and Diet

Polypterus delhezi is a carnivorous predator in the wild, feeding on smaller fish, crustaceans, and insects. In
captivity, it should be provided with a varied diet of high-quality frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, shrimp, and
small fish. It can also be trained to accept sinking pellets designed for carnivorous fish. Feeding should take place in
the evening or at night, as this aligns with its natural nocturnal habits. Ensure that the food reaches the bottom of
the tank, where Polypterus delhezi typically feeds.

## Care and Maintenance

Polypterus delhezi is relatively hardy but requires specific care to thrive. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
essential to maintain water quality. Due to its ability to breathe atmospheric air, ensure that it can easily access the
water surface. Keep the tank covered to prevent escapes, and regularly monitor water parameters to avoid sudden changes
in water chemistry. Polypterus delhezi is prone to common fish diseases, so maintaining a clean environment and
providing a balanced diet are key to its health.

## Compatibility

Polypterus delhezi is generally peaceful but should not be kept with very small fish, as it may view them as prey.
Suitable tank mates include other large, non-aggressive species such as larger catfish, cichlids, and larger characins.
Avoid keeping it with fin-nipping species or very aggressive fish, as Polypterus delhezi has delicate fins that can be
easily damaged. Ensure that tank mates are not small enough to be eaten and share similar water parameter requirements.

## Breeding

Breeding Polypterus delhezi in captivity is rare and challenging due to its specific breeding requirements. In the wild,
Polypterus delhezi spawns during the rainy season, laying eggs in dense vegetation. To replicate these conditions in an
aquarium, provide a large, heavily planted tank with a slightly lowered water level. Condition the fish with a diet rich
in live foods. If successful, the female will scatter eggs, which should be collected and transferred to a separate
breeding tank to prevent them from being eaten. The eggs will hatch within a few days, and the fry can be fed infusoria
or newly hatched brine shrimp until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
