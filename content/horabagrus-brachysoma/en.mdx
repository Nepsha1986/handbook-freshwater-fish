## Overview

**Horabagrus brachysoma**, commonly known as the **Yellow Catfish**, **Golden Catfish**, or **Sun Catfish**, is a
peaceful catfish species native to the rivers and lakes of India. This species can grow up to 30-40 cm and has a
lifespan of 8-10 years. The fish is easily recognizable due to its striking yellow color and black markings on its body.
While they are nocturnal and prefer hiding during the day, their calm demeanor makes them suitable for large community
tanks with peaceful species.

## Tank Requirements

The **Yellow Catfish** requires a spacious tank of at least 250 liters due to its potential size. The ideal water
temperature ranges from 22-28Â°C, with a pH level between 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) from 5-15. The tank should be
decorated with hiding places such as caves or driftwood, as they enjoy staying hidden during the day. Provide a soft
substrate and ensure moderate water flow to replicate their natural river habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

**Horabagrus brachysoma** is omnivorous and not very picky about its diet. In the wild, they feed on small fish,
invertebrates, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed a mix of high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such
as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and chopped fish. They should be fed in the evening or at night, as they are nocturnal
feeders.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the **Yellow Catfish** requires regular water changes of 25-30% weekly due to their size and bioload. They
are generally hardy fish but can be sensitive to poor water conditions. Ensure the tank has good filtration to maintain
clean water, as this species produces a lot of waste. Regular monitoring of water parameters is essential to keep them
healthy.

## Compatibility

These fish are peaceful and can coexist with other large, non-aggressive species. However, due to their size, small fish
may be at risk of being eaten. They do well in community tanks with larger cichlids, loaches, or other robust species.
Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive or territorial tank mates.

## Breeding

Breeding **Horabagrus brachysoma** in captivity is challenging. They are egg layers, and breeding attempts require a
large, well-decorated tank with soft water conditions. During breeding, males will chase females around the tank, and
the female will deposit eggs in secluded areas. It's essential to remove the adults after spawning, as they might eat
the eggs. Raising the fry can be difficult, and they need to be fed with specialized fry food until they grow large
enough for standard feed.
