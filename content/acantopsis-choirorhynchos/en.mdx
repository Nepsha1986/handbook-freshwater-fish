## Introduction

Acantopsis choirorhynchos, more commonly known as the Horseface Loach or Long-nosed Loach, is a freshwater fish native
to the rivers and streams of Southeast Asia. Known for its burrowing behavior and peaceful nature, it is a fascinating
addition to any aquarium. This species is renowned for its distinctive elongated snout, which resembles a horse’s face,
and its ability to burrow into soft substrates. Its peaceful temperament and intriguing behavior make it a popular
choice among aquarium enthusiasts. In this article, we’ll explore the key aspects of caring for, feeding, and
maintaining this remarkable fish.

## Appearance and Behavior

The Horseface Loach gets its name from its unique, elongated snout, which gives it a horse-like appearance. Its body is
slender and streamlined, covered with small scales and equipped with delicate fins. The coloration typically ranges from
light brown to gray, often adorned with dark spots or stripes that help it blend into its natural environment.

This species is well-known for its burrowing behavior, a natural defense mechanism. In an aquarium, they often bury
themselves in sand or fine gravel, leaving only their eyes exposed. Horseface Loaches are peaceful and social fish,
preferring to live in groups of 3–5 individuals. They are most active during the evening and night, making them an
interesting addition to observe.

## Aquarium Requirements

### Water Parameters

- **Tank Size**: A minimum tank size of 50 gallons (200 liters) is recommended for a group of 3–5 Horseface Loaches. For
  larger groups or community tanks, a 75-gallon (300-liter) tank or larger is ideal.
- **Temperature**: 72–82°F (22–28°C).
- **pH**: 6.5–7.5.
- **Water Hardness (GH)**: 5–12 dGH.

### Tank Setup

Horseface Loaches require a soft substrate, such as sand or fine gravel, to allow them to burrow safely. Sharp stones or
coarse gravel can injure their delicate bodies.

It’s important to provide plenty of hiding spots using driftwood, rocks, and live plants. These elements help replicate
their natural habitat and reduce stress. Moderate water flow and good aeration are also essential, as they mimic the
fast-moving streams where these fish are found.

### Filtration and Water Changes

These fish are sensitive to water quality, so a powerful filtration system and regular water changes are crucial.
Perform weekly water changes of 20–30% to maintain clean and stable water conditions.

## Feeding

Horseface Loaches are omnivores and in the wild, they feed on small invertebrates, larvae, and organic detritus. In an
aquarium, their diet should include:

- **Sinking pellets** and **tablets** designed for bottom-dwelling fish.
- **Live or frozen foods**: bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.
- **Vegetable supplements**: blanched spinach, zucchini, or cucumber.

Feed them 1–2 times a day in small portions to avoid overfeeding and maintain water quality. Ensure the food reaches the
bottom of the tank, as these fish rarely surface to feed.

## Compatibility with Other Fish

Horseface Loaches are peaceful and get along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tankmates include:

- **Tetras** (neons, rummy noses).
- **Rasboras**.
- **Small gouramis**.
- **Corydoras** and other peaceful bottom-dwellers.

Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, such as cichlids, which may intimidate or harm the loaches.

## Breeding

Breeding Horseface Loaches in captivity is extremely challenging and rarely successful. In the wild, they spawn during
seasonal floods, which is difficult to replicate in an aquarium. However, if you wish to attempt breeding, here are some
recommendations:

1. **Breeding Tank**: Set up a separate tank of 25–40 gallons (100–150 liters) with soft water (pH 6.0–6.5) and a
   temperature of 79–82°F (26–28°C).
2. **Triggering Spawning**: Simulate the rainy season by increasing water changes and slightly lowering the temperature
   by 2–3°F (1–2°C).
3. **Feeding**: Provide plenty of live foods to condition the fish for spawning.
4. **Caring for Eggs**: After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in a
   few days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or freshly hatched brine shrimp.

## Conclusion

Acantopsis choirorhynchos, the Horseface Loach, is a unique and fascinating fish that makes an excellent addition to any
aquarium with a soft substrate and peaceful tankmates. Its unusual appearance and intriguing behavior make it a true
standout in any aquatic setup. By following the care guidelines outlined above, you can ensure your Horseface Loaches
thrive and bring joy to your aquarium for years to come.
