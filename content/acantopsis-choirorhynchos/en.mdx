## Overview

Acantopsis choirorhynchos, commonly known as the Horseface Loach, is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. This
species is characterized by its elongated, horse-like snout and its ability to burrow into the substrate. These loaches
are peaceful and active bottom dwellers, making them an excellent addition to community aquariums with soft, sandy
substrates.

## Tank Requirements

A spacious tank of at least 200 liters is recommended for the Horseface Loach. It thrives in temperatures between
22-28Â°C, with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-12. Since these loaches are burrowers, a fine sandy
substrate is essential to prevent injury. Provide plenty of hiding spots using driftwood, caves, and plants to mimic
their natural riverbed habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Horseface Loaches are omnivores and primarily feed on small invertebrates in the wild. In an aquarium, they accept
high-quality sinking pellets, frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Occasional vegetable
matter, such as blanched spinach or zucchini, can be offered to ensure a well-balanced diet.

## Care and Maintenance

These loaches require clean, well-oxygenated water with moderate flow to simulate their natural environment. Weekly
water changes of 20-30% are necessary to maintain water quality. Because they are burrowers, the substrate should be
soft and free from sharp edges. They are best kept in small groups, as they exhibit social behaviors when kept with
their own kind.

## Compatibility

Horseface Loaches are peaceful and can be kept with other non-aggressive species, including tetras, rasboras, and
gouramis. They should not be housed with large, aggressive fish that might intimidate them. They prefer the company of
their own species and will thrive in groups of three or more.

## Breeding

Breeding Acantopsis choirorhynchos in captivity is extremely rare, with little documentation on successful reproduction.
In the wild, they are believed to spawn during seasonal floods, making it difficult to replicate their breeding
conditions in a home aquarium.
