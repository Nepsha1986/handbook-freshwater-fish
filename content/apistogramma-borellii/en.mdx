## Overview

**Apistogramma borellii**, commonly known as **Borelli's Dwarf Cichlid** or **Umbrella Cichlid**, is a colorful and
peaceful species native to South America. It is a popular choice for community tanks due to its small size (5-7 cm) and
peaceful temperament. The males are more colorful, typically displaying shades of blue and yellow. This species is
relatively hardy and can adapt to a variety of water conditions.

## Tank Requirements

**Apistogramma borellii** thrives in small to medium tanks with a minimum volume of 50 liters. The water temperature
should be kept between 22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 5.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-12. Provide plenty of
hiding spaces with plants, caves, and driftwood. Soft, slightly acidic water with dim lighting mimics their natural
habitat and will help them feel comfortable.

## Feeding and Diet

**Borelli's Dwarf Cichlids** are omnivores and will accept a wide range of foods in captivity. They thrive on a diet of
high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Supplementing their diet with
vegetable matter such as spirulina flakes will also be beneficial. A varied diet will help enhance their colors and
promote overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is relatively easy to care for, but like all dwarf cichlids, they prefer stable water conditions. Regular
water changes and tank maintenance are essential to keep them healthy. A well-maintained tank with consistent parameters
will prevent stress and reduce the risk of disease. Moderate filtration and good oxygenation are recommended.

## Compatibility

**Apistogramma borellii** is peaceful and can coexist with other small, non-aggressive species in a community tank. Good
tank mates include small tetras, rasboras, and other peaceful fish. Avoid aggressive or overly active species, as they
can stress the cichlids. Males may become territorial during breeding, so providing plenty of hiding spots will help
reduce conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding **Apistogramma borellii** is relatively easy in a well-maintained tank. They are cave spawners, and the female
will lay eggs in a hidden spot such as a cave or under a piece of driftwood. After spawning, the female guards the eggs
while the male protects the territory. The eggs hatch in 2-3 days, and the fry become free-swimming within a week. Feed
the fry with infusoria or powdered fry food.
