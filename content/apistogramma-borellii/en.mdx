## Overview

_Apistogramma borellii_ is a small dwarf cichlid from the Cichlidae family, native to slow-moving waters of South
America — the Paraguay and Parana river basins in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. In the aquarium hobby, this species
is also known as the "Umbrella Cichlid" due to the male's distinctive fan-shaped dorsal fin.

Adults reach 5–7 cm in length and live for 4–6 years with proper care. Sexual dimorphism is pronounced: males are
larger, with elongated fins and a striking blue-yellow coloration with iridescent hues, while females are smaller, more
modestly colored in predominantly yellow tones, and develop an intense yellow coloration during spawning.

Among other apistogrammas, such as [Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides) or
[Agassiz's Dwarf Cichlid](/en/apistogramma-agassizii), _A. borellii_ stands out for its particularly calm disposition,
making it an excellent choice for beginners venturing into the world of dwarf cichlids.

## Tank Requirements

A pair of _Apistogramma borellii_ requires a tank of at least **50 liters**. If you plan to keep a group of one male and
several females, or a community tank with other species, an 80-liter or larger tank is preferable.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 22–28 °C
- **pH:** 5.0–7.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 5–12

In the wild, these fish inhabit areas among submerged roots and leaf litter, so it's important to recreate a similar
environment in the aquarium. Use soft sandy substrate, driftwood, and scattered rocks to create hiding spots. Live
plants — anubias, cryptocorynes, mosses — not only serve as shelter but also help maintain soft, slightly acidic water.
Adding dried oak or Indian almond leaves will tint the water a natural amber shade and provide beneficial tannins.

Lighting should be subdued — bright light causes stress and makes these fish retreat into hiding. Water flow should be
gentle to moderate.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apistogramma borellii_ is an omnivorous species with a preference for animal-based foods. In the wild, they feed on
small invertebrates, insect larvae, and microorganisms.

In the aquarium, the base diet should consist of high-quality small cichlid pellets or flakes. However, to maintain
health and vibrant coloration, it is essential to regularly offer live and frozen foods:

- **Brine shrimp** — an excellent staple live food
- **Daphnia** — beneficial for digestion
- **Bloodworms** — offer 1–2 times per week as a treat
- **Cyclops** — ideal due to their small size

Feed small portions twice a day. Borelli's cichlids feed primarily near the bottom and in the middle water column, so
ensure the food sinks to their level. A weekly fasting day is beneficial.

## Care and Maintenance

Although the care level for _A. borellii_ is considered relatively low, these fish require stable conditions. Sudden
fluctuations in water parameters are the primary source of stress and disease.

Key care recommendations:

- **Water changes:** 20–25% weekly, using conditioned water with matching parameters
- **Filtration:** moderate, without strong current — a sponge filter or internal filter with adjustable flow works well
- **Temperature:** maintain stable temperature, avoiding sudden shifts
- **Substrate:** regularly vacuum the bottom, especially in feeding areas

Pay attention to the fish's behavior: if your borelli's are constantly hiding, losing color, or refusing food, this
signals water quality issues or stress from tankmates. Healthy specimens are active during the day, curious, and
vibrantly colored.

## Compatibility

_Apistogramma borellii_ is one of the most peaceful dwarf cichlids, making it an ideal candidate for a community tank.
The best tankmates are small, calm fish that inhabit the upper and middle water layers:

- [Neon Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-innesi) and [Cardinal Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi) — classic companions for
  apistogrammas
- [Ember Tetra](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae) — a peaceful nano tetra
- [Dwarf Pencilfish](/en/nannostomus-marginatus) — a calm upper-level swimmer
- [Panda Corydoras](/en/corydoras-panda) and [Pygmy Corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus) — peaceful bottom dwellers
- [Otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus) — a useful algae eater

Avoid large, aggressive, or overly active fish. It is not recommended to keep two males of _A. borellii_ in a small
tank, as this will lead to conflicts. The optimal arrangement is one male with 2–3 females.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma borellii_ in a home aquarium is quite achievable and accessible even for less experienced
aquarists, though some preparation is required.

To stimulate spawning, slightly raise the temperature (to 26–27 °C), reduce water hardness, and provide plenty of hiding
spots — coconut shells, ceramic tubes, or small rock caves work well. The female selects a shelter and deposits 40–80
eggs on the cave ceiling.

After spawning, the female takes full responsibility for the clutch: she fans the eggs, removes unfertilized ones, and
aggressively guards the nest, including from the male. It is best not to disturb the female during this period.

The larvae hatch in 2–3 days, and the fry become free-swimming approximately one week later. First foods should include
artemia nauplii and infusoria. The female continues to guard her offspring for several more weeks, leading the school of
fry around the tank in search of food. This is one of the most fascinating spectacles in the aquarium hobby.
