## Overview

**Gymnocorymbus ternetzi**, commonly known as the Black Tetra, is a popular freshwater fish originating from the rivers
of South America. With its distinctive black and silver coloration, this species can grow to a size of 5-7 cm and
typically has a lifespan of 3 to 5 years.

Black Tetras are social fish and thrive in schools, making them a great addition to community tanks. Their active and
playful nature adds vibrancy to the aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

**Gymnocorymbus ternetzi** prefer slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general hardness
(GH) between 5-20 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 22-28Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 80 liters.

Providing a well-planted aquarium with open swimming space is essential for these fish. They enjoy areas with floating
plants or dense vegetation, where they can feel secure and explore.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Gymnocorymbus ternetzi** are omnivorous and feed on a variety of small invertebrates, insects, and plant
matter. In captivity, they readily accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp
and daphnia.

To maintain their health, it's important to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and plant-based foods.
Feeding should occur once or twice daily, ensuring they consume their meals within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Black Tetras are relatively easy to care for, but maintaining good water quality is crucial. Regular water changes of
20-30% each week are recommended to keep the environment clean. A reliable filtration system helps keep the water
well-oxygenated.

Since they are peaceful and social fish, they do well in community tanks. It's best to avoid aggressive species that may
intimidate or stress them.

## Compatibility

**Gymnocorymbus ternetzi** are best kept with other peaceful fish that share similar water parameters. Suitable
tankmates include tetras, rasboras, and small cichlids. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive species, as they
may become stressed or harassed.

Providing adequate swimming space and hiding spots will help these fish feel secure and reduce stress in the aquarium
environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Gymnocorymbus ternetzi** in captivity is relatively straightforward. A separate breeding tank with suitable
spawning sites, such as fine-leaved plants, is recommended.

During spawning, the female will scatter eggs among the plants, and the fry should be fed infusoria or finely crushed
flakes once they are free-swimming. It's essential to separate the fry from the adults to prevent them from being eaten.
