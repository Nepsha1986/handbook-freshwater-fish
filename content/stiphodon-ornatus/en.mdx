## Overview

Stiphodon ornatus, commonly known as the Ornate Goby, is a freshwater fish belonging to the Gobiidae family. Native to
streams and rivers in Southeast Asia, it is recognized for its striking blue and orange coloration. This species prefers
a calm, well-oxygenated environment with plenty of hiding spots.

## Tank Requirements

The Ornate Goby requires a minimum tank size of 80 liters. The water temperature should be maintained between 24-28Â°C,
with a pH range of 6.5-7.5. The water hardness (GH) should range between 5-15. The tank should be equipped with a strong
filtration system to ensure water is clean and well-oxygenated. Providing plenty of rocks, plants, and driftwood will
help create a more natural environment for this species.

## Feeding and Diet

Stiphodon ornatus is an omnivore, feeding on a variety of foods in its natural habitat, including algae, biofilm, and
small invertebrates. In the aquarium, it can be fed a combination of high-quality pellets, live or frozen food, and
algae-based foods. It is recommended to feed them small meals twice a day.

## Care and Maintenance

This species requires moderate care. Regular water changes (at least 25% per week) and maintaining water quality are
essential for their health. Ensure that the tank is well-maintained, with an appropriate filter and aeration. Keep an
eye on their health, as poor water conditions can lead to skin issues and stress.

## Compatibility

Stiphodon ornatus is generally peaceful and can coexist with other non-aggressive species in a community tank. Ideal
tank mates include other small, peaceful fish such as tetras, rasboras, and loaches. Avoid keeping them with large or
overly aggressive fish that may bully or harm them.

## Breeding

Breeding Stiphodon ornatus in captivity can be challenging. A separate breeding tank is recommended, with slightly
higher water flow to mimic natural conditions. Males are often more colorful than females, and they may display vibrant
coloration during courtship. Once the eggs are laid, the parents should be removed, as they do not provide parental
care. The fry will require small foods like infusoria and baby brine shrimp until they grow larger.
