## Overview

The Ornate Goby (_Stiphodon ornatus_) is a small freshwater fish from the Gobiidae family, found in fast-flowing
mountain streams and rivers in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. This species attracts aquarists primarily
due to its striking sexual dimorphism: males display a vivid blue-green body coloration with orange-red markings on
their fins, while females are more modestly colored in grayish-brown tones with thin stripes.

In the wild, _Stiphodon ornatus_ inhabits shallow sections of rivers with rocky bottoms and strong currents, feeding on
biofilm and algal growth on rocks. Adults reach only 5–6 cm in size, making them suitable inhabitants for smaller
aquariums.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females?

- **Coloration**: Males display vibrant blue-green or blue coloration with orange accents. Females have subdued
  grayish-brown coloring.
- **Fins**: Males have more developed and brightly colored dorsal and anal fins.
- **Size**: Males are usually slightly larger and more slender than females.
- **Behavior**: Males actively display their colors, especially in the presence of rivals or females.

## Tank Requirements

A group of Stiphodon gobies requires an aquarium of at least **80 liters**. The key requirement is recreating a mountain
stream biotope with strong water flow. Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature**: 24–28°C
- **pH**: 6.5–7.5
- **Hardness (dGH)**: 5–15

Fine gravel or pebbles work best as substrate. Rocks of various sizes stacked together will serve both as hiding spots
and as surfaces for biofilm growth — their primary food source. Live plants such as Anubias and mosses complement the
setup nicely but are not strictly necessary.

Powerful filtration with strong current and good aeration are critical — Stiphodon gobies are extremely sensitive to
oxygen levels. The aquarium must have a tight-fitting lid, as these fish are prone to escaping.

## Feeding and Diet

_Stiphodon ornatus_ is a predominantly herbivorous species. In the wild, the fish feeds on biofilm and microalgae, which
it scrapes from rocks using its specialized mouthparts.

In the aquarium, the diet should primarily consist of:

- Algal growth on rocks and glass (the aquarium must be well-established)
- Specialized spirulina-based foods
- Blanched vegetables: zucchini, cucumber, spinach
- As a supplement — frozen bloodworm, brine shrimp, daphnia (no more than 1–2 times per week)

Important: the aquarium for Stiphodon gobies must be well-matured with an established biological balance. In a freshly
set up tank without biofilm, the fish may starve.

## Care and Maintenance

The Ornate Goby requires moderate but consistent care. Weekly water changes of 25–30% are essential to maintain water
quality. It is important not to disturb the biofilm on rocks, which serves as the primary food source.

Water parameters should be monitored regularly with test kits, paying special attention to nitrate levels and oxygen
content. The filter should be rinsed in aquarium water to preserve beneficial bacteria.

With proper care, the lifespan is 5–8 years. The main health issues are related to insufficient nutrition in an immature
tank and poor water quality.

## Compatibility

_Stiphodon ornatus_ is a peaceful bottom-dwelling fish that coexists well with other small species preferring similar
conditions. Excellent tank mates include:

- [Chili Rasbora](/en/boraras-brigittae) and other small rasboras
- [Celestial Pearl Danio](/en/danio-margaritatus)
- [Pygmy Corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus) and other small corydoras
- [Otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus)
- Small tetras such as the [Neon Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-innesi)

Males may show territoriality toward each other, but serious conflicts rarely occur when sufficient space is provided.
They should not be kept with large or aggressive species, nor with active bottom-dwellers that would compete for shelter
and food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Stiphodon ornatus_ in an aquarium is extremely challenging, primarily due to the species' unique life cycle.
In the wild, this species is amphidromous: after hatching, the larvae are carried by the current into brackish or
saltwater, where they undergo early development stages before the juveniles migrate back to freshwater rivers.

Replicating these conditions in a home aquarium is virtually impossible. Spawning can occur: the male attracts a female
with its bright coloration and prepares a shelter under a rock where the female deposits fine eggs. However, raising the
larvae requires transferring them to brackish water with a specific plankton composition, making this process accessible
only to professional breeders.

Most Stiphodon gobies available in the trade are wild-caught specimens.
