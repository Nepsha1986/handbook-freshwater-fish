## Overview

The Hockey Stick Pencilfish (_Nannostomus eques_), also known as the Brown Pencilfish, is a small, peaceful fish from
the Lebiasinidae family. Native to the slow-moving waters of the Amazon Basin, this fish is well-known for its unique
diagonal swimming posture, resembling a hockey stick. Its slender body and calm demeanor make it an ideal addition to
community tanks with other non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 50 liters is recommended for the Hockey Stick Pencilfish, with a temperature range of 23-28Â°C, pH
of 5.5-7.5, and GH of 5-12. The tank should be well-planted with plenty of hiding spots, low lighting, and a dark
substrate to help replicate their natural habitat. These fish prefer soft, acidic water and thrive in a calm environment
with minimal water flow.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, the Hockey Stick Pencilfish primarily feeds on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they
accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and frozen or live foods like brine shrimp,
daphnia, and mosquito larvae. They should be fed small portions multiple times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is sensitive to water quality, so regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are essential. The tank should be
well-maintained with gentle filtration. As they are prone to stress in bright lighting, ensure moderate or subdued
lighting to help them feel comfortable.

## Compatibility

The Hockey Stick Pencilfish is a peaceful, shoaling species best kept in groups of at least six. They are compatible
with other peaceful tank mates like small tetras, rasboras, and dwarf catfish. Aggressive or boisterous species should
be avoided.

## Breeding

Breeding the Hockey Stick Pencilfish in captivity can be challenging. They are egg-scatterers and require soft, slightly
acidic water to encourage spawning. To increase the chances of success, provide a separate breeding tank with
fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs, and feed
the fry with infusoria or powdered fry food once they hatch.
