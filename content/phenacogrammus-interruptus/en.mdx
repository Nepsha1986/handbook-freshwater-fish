## Overview

The Congo Tetra (_Phenacogrammus interruptus_) belongs to the Alestidae family and is native to the Congo River Basin in
Africa. Known for its stunning iridescent colors and long flowing fins, this peaceful species is a favorite among
aquarists. It thrives in larger aquariums with dense vegetation and plenty of open space for swimming.

## Tank Requirements

Congo Tetras need a minimum tank size of 100 liters. The ideal water temperature ranges between 23-27Â°C, with a pH of
6.0-7.5 and moderate hardness (GH 5-15). They prefer a planted tank with subdued lighting to mimic their natural
habitat. Including plants and driftwood helps create hiding spots and enhances their coloration.

## Feeding and Diet

These fish are omnivores and enjoy a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects and plant matter. In an
aquarium, they should be provided with a balanced diet of high-quality flake food, small pellets, and occasional live or
frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms.

## Care and Maintenance

Congo Tetras are relatively hardy but require clean, well-oxygenated water. Regular water changes and a good filtration
system are recommended. They are susceptible to stress if kept in inadequate conditions, so maintaining stable water
parameters is essential.

## Compatibility

Congo Tetras are peaceful and do well in community tanks. They should be kept in groups of at least six to reduce stress
and encourage natural schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include other peaceful fish like rasboras, dwarf cichlids,
and small catfish.

## Breeding

Breeding Congo Tetras in captivity is possible but requires specific conditions. They are egg scatterers, and spawning
is triggered by slightly acidic water and the right temperature. Use a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants or
a spawning mop, and remove the adults after spawning to protect the eggs.
