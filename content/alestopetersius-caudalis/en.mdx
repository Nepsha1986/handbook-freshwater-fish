## Overview

Alestopetersius caudalis, commonly known as the Yellow-Tail Congo Tetra or Caudalfin Tetra, is a small, peaceful fish
originating from the rivers of Central Africa. These fish are distinguished by their shimmering bodies and vibrant
yellow tail fins, making them a beautiful addition to any aquarium. They typically grow to a size of 5-6 cm and thrive
in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

The Yellow-Tail Congo Tetra requires a well-maintained tank of at least 60 liters. The ideal water temperature should be
between 23-27°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-15 dGH. A densely planted tank with open
swimming spaces and gentle water flow will mimic their natural habitat and keep them comfortable. Regular water changes
and a quality filtration system are crucial for maintaining water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Alestopetersius caudalis is an omnivore, feeding on small invertebrates, plant matter, and algae. In an
aquarium setting, they will accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, micro-pellets, and live or
frozen foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia. A varied diet will help maintain their health and vibrant coloration.
Feed them small portions 2-3 times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Yellow-Tail Congo Tetra is straightforward, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced
aquarists. Regular maintenance includes weekly water changes of 25-30% and monitoring of water parameters. Ensure that
the tank has sufficient plants and hiding places to reduce stress and encourage natural behavior. Regularly check for
signs of disease or stress, and take immediate action if any issues arise.

## Compatibility

The Yellow-Tail Congo Tetra is a peaceful species that does well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive
fish. Suitable tank mates include other tetras, rasboras, and peaceful bottom-dwellers like Corydoras. They should not
be kept with larger or aggressive species that may cause them stress or harm.

## Breeding

Breeding Alestopetersius caudalis in captivity is possible, though it can be challenging. A separate breeding tank with
slightly acidic water (pH around 6.5) and a temperature of 25-27°C is recommended. These fish are egg scatterers, so
it's important to provide fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop to protect the eggs from being eaten. Once the eggs are
laid, the adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-36 hours,
and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food until they grow large enough for more substantial food.
