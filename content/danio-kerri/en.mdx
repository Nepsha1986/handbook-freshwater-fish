## Overview

Danio kerri, commonly known as Blue Danio, is a vibrant freshwater fish originating from Southeast Asia. Its striking
blue and purple hues make it an eye-catching addition to any community aquarium. Like other danios, Danio kerri is an
active schooling fish that enjoys being in groups.

## Tank Requirements

Danio kerri requires a minimum tank size of 50 liters. The ideal water temperature is between 22-26Â°C, with a pH level
of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness of 5-15 dGH. These fish prefer a planted tank with ample open swimming space and a gentle
current to replicate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Blue Danios feed on small insects, larvae, and plankton. In the aquarium, they are omnivorous and will
accept a wide variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, pellets, and live or frozen foods such as brine
shrimp and daphnia. A varied diet helps maintain their vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio kerri is relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water changes,
efficient filtration, and good water movement are essential to keeping these active fish healthy. Monitor water
parameters to ensure stable conditions, and watch for signs of stress or illness.

## Compatibility

Blue Danios are peaceful fish that do well in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. Good tank mates include
small tetras, rasboras, and corydoras. They should be kept in schools of at least 6 to reduce stress and encourage
natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio kerri in captivity is achievable but requires careful attention. These fish are egg scatterers, and a
well-planted breeding tank will increase the chances of successful breeding. Remove the adults after spawning to protect
the eggs. The fry will hatch in 2-3 days and should be fed infusoria or powdered fry food until they are large enough to
accept larger food.
