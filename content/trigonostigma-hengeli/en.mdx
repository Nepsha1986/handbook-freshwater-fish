## Overview

**Trigonostigma hengeli**, commonly known as Hengel's Rasbora, is a small, peaceful fish popular in the aquarium hobby.
Native to slow-moving streams and rivers of Southeast Asia, these fish are often found in soft, acidic waters with dense
plant cover. Their small size, calm temperament, and striking appearance make them ideal for nano tanks and planted
aquariums.

They grow to about 2-3 cm in length and live for around 3-5 years in captivity, making them great for aquarists looking
for a serene, low-maintenance fish species.

## Tank Requirements

**Trigonostigma hengeli** prefer water temperatures between 24-28°C, with a pH of 6.0-7.0 and a water hardness of 5-12
GH. A minimum tank volume of 30 liters is recommended, although larger setups are always beneficial.

They thrive in planted tanks, where they can find hiding spots and feel more secure. Low lighting, along with floating
plants, mimics their natural environment and helps highlight their colors.

## Feeding and Diet

These fish are omnivores and will accept a variety of foods. A quality micro-pellet or flake food should form the base
of their diet, supplemented with occasional live or frozen foods like daphnia, brine shrimp, or microworms to enhance
their coloration and health.

They also enjoy small portions of vegetable matter, such as blanched spinach or zucchini.

## Care and Maintenance

Hengel's Rasboras are quite hardy and easy to care for, requiring only basic maintenance. Regular water changes, stable
water parameters, and a well-maintained filtration system will keep them healthy.

They are a shoaling species, so it’s important to keep them in groups of at least six to encourage their natural
schooling behavior. This also reduces stress and promotes a more natural display of their social dynamics.

## Compatibility

Hengel's Rasboras are peaceful fish that do well in community aquariums with other small, non-aggressive species like
small tetras, rasboras, or dwarf catfish. They also pair well with shrimp in planted tanks.

Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, as they can easily become stressed and may retreat into hiding if
intimidated.

## Breeding

Breeding **Trigonostigma hengeli** can be achieved in home aquariums, although it may require a separate breeding setup.
They are egg layers and prefer laying their eggs on the undersides of broad-leaf plants or among fine-leaved plants like
Java moss.

The parents should be removed after spawning, as they may eat the eggs. The eggs hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can
be fed with infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to consume baby brine shrimp.
