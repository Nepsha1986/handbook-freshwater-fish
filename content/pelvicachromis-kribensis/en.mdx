## Overview

**Pelvicachromis kribensis**, commonly known as the Kribensis or Rainbow Krib, is a small, colorful cichlid species from
the freshwater rivers and streams of West Africa. They are popular in the aquarium hobby for their vibrant colors,
relatively peaceful nature, and ease of breeding.

Kribensis grow to a size of 7-10 cm, with males typically being larger and more colorful than females. They have a
lifespan of 5-8 years and are generally easy to care for, making them a great choice for both beginner and experienced
aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Kribensis are comfortable in a well-planted tank with a minimum volume of 70 liters. They thrive in soft to moderately
hard water with a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Providing caves and hiding spots is
essential, as they prefer to have sheltered areas to retreat to.

A mix of open swimming space and vegetation is ideal for their habitat. Strong filtration and regular water changes will
help maintain optimal water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

**Pelvicachromis kribensis** are omnivores, feeding on a variety of foods in their natural habitat. In the aquarium,
they should be offered a diet that includes high-quality flakes or pellets, supplemented with live or frozen foods like
brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. A balanced diet will enhance their coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Kribensis are hardy fish and generally easy to care for. They tolerate a range of water conditions, but it’s important
to maintain stable water parameters. Regular water changes and proper filtration will help keep them healthy.

They are relatively peaceful but may display territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They do well in community
tanks with other peaceful species, but avoid housing them with overly aggressive or large tankmates.

## Compatibility

**Pelvicachromis kribensis** are generally peaceful and can coexist with a variety of similarly sized community fish.
Suitable tankmates include tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive species, as
this can lead to stress.

Providing hiding places and well-defined territories will help minimize territorial disputes, especially if you have
more than one pair in the tank.

## Breeding

Kribensis are prolific breeders and relatively easy to spawn in captivity. They are cave spawners, with the female
laying eggs inside a cave or sheltered area. After fertilization, the female guards the eggs while the male defends the
territory.

The eggs hatch in 3-5 days, and the fry become free-swimming after another 5-7 days. Parents will typically care for the
fry, but you can offer them finely crushed flake food or baby brine shrimp as they grow.
