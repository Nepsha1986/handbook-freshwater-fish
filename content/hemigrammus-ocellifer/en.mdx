## Overview

Hemigrammus ocellifer, commonly known as the Head and Tail Light Tetra, is a popular freshwater fish from the Amazon
Basin in South America. It gets its name from the distinctive reflective spots at the base of its tail and behind its
eyes, resembling tiny lights. This small, schooling fish typically grows to 4-5 cm in length and can live for 5-7 years
in a well-maintained aquarium. Hemigrammus ocellifer is an excellent choice for community tanks due to its peaceful
nature and striking appearance.

## Tank Requirements

The Head and Tail Light Tetra thrives in a well-planted aquarium with plenty of swimming space. A minimum tank size of
60 liters is recommended, with water temperatures between 22-28°C, a pH range of 6.0-7.5, and general hardness (GH) of
4-15. These tetras prefer subdued lighting and dark substrates that mimic their natural environment. A gentle water
flow, achieved with a filter, is ideal. Ensure the tank has plenty of plants, such as Java moss or Anubias, and open
areas for swimming.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Hemigrammus ocellifer feeds on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they should be offered a
varied diet consisting of high-quality flake food, micro-pellets, and live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia,
and bloodworms. Feeding small amounts multiple times a day will keep them healthy and enhance their coloration.
Providing a balanced diet will also help in maintaining their overall health and longevity.

## Care and Maintenance

Hemigrammus ocellifer is relatively easy to care for, making it suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water changes
of 20-25% weekly are essential to maintain water quality. Since these fish are sensitive to poor water conditions,
monitoring parameters such as temperature, pH, and hardness is crucial. A clean and stable environment will help prevent
common diseases like ich. Additionally, it's important to maintain good filtration and ensure the tank is cycled before
introducing the fish.

## Compatibility

The Head and Tail Light Tetra is a peaceful species that does well in a community aquarium. They should be kept in
schools of at least six individuals to ensure they feel secure. Suitable tank mates include other small, non-aggressive
fish such as rasboras, small tetras, Corydoras catfish, and dwarf gouramis. Avoid keeping them with larger, aggressive
species that may see them as prey. Their peaceful demeanor and compatibility with various species make them a great
choice for a harmonious aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding Hemigrammus ocellifer in captivity can be challenging but is achievable with the right conditions. A separate
breeding tank with slightly acidic water (pH 6.0-6.5) and a temperature around 26-28°C is recommended. The breeding tank
should be dimly lit, with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop where the female can scatter eggs. Conditioning the
breeding pair with live foods will increase the chances of successful spawning. After spawning, the adults should be
removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed
infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
