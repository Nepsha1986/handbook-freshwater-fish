## Overview

_Aulonocara sp. Orchid Red_, commonly known as the Strawberry Peacock, is one of the most visually striking selectively
bred Aulonocara forms. This fish does not occur in the wild and was developed through targeted breeding of several
Aulonocara species from Lake Malawi. Its main appeal is the rich red-orange body coloration, which becomes especially
vivid in mature males. Females are considerably more subdued, displaying greyish-pink tones.

Adults reach 10–12 cm in length and live 5–7 years with proper care. Despite its artificial origin, this fish retains
typical Aulonocara behavior: a calm disposition, the habit of sifting sand for food, and maternal mouthbrooding. Thanks
to its peaceful nature and moderate care requirements, it is an excellent choice for aquarists looking to build a
colorful Malawi tank.

## Tank Requirements

A group of one male and 2–3 females needs an aquarium of at least 150 liters. Water parameters: temperature 24–28°C, pH
7.5–8.5, hardness GH 10–15. Like all Malawi cichlids, the Strawberry Peacock requires efficient filtration and stable
water conditions.

Use fine sand as substrate — Aulonocara actively sift through it while foraging, and coarse gravel can damage their
gills. Decorate with rock formations creating caves and hiding spots, but leave plenty of open swimming space. Driftwood
is best avoided as it acidifies the water, which is unsuitable for Malawi cichlids. For plants, use hardy species like
Anubias and Java fern attached to rocks.

## Feeding and Diet

Despite its selective breeding origins, the Strawberry Peacock's dietary needs are typical for the genus — it is a
micro-predator that feeds on small invertebrates. In the aquarium, high-quality cichlid pellets should form the staple
diet. Supplement with frozen foods: brine shrimp, bloodworms, cyclops, and daphnia.

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions consumed within 2–3 minutes. Overfeeding is dangerous — it leads to obesity and
digestive problems. A weekly fasting day is beneficial. Quality and varied nutrition directly affects color intensity —
a poor diet will cause the bright red tones to fade noticeably.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25–30% are essential for keeping Malawi cichlids healthy. Vacuum the substrate regularly to
remove food waste and debris. Monitor water parameters with test kits: ammonia and nitrites must be at zero, nitrates
below 20 mg/l.

Watch for signs of illness — loss of appetite, faded coloration, lethargy, or abdominal swelling may indicate Malawi
bloat, a common condition in Malawi cichlids. Prevention is straightforward: clean water, stable parameters, and a
balanced diet. At the first signs of disease, immediately check water quality and adjust conditions.

## Compatibility

The Strawberry Peacock is one of the most peaceful Malawi cichlids. It coexists well with other Aulonocara species such
as the [Emperor Cichlid](/en/aulonocara-nyassae) and [Malawi Butterfly](/en/aulonocara-jacobfreibergi), as well as
peaceful mbuna like the [Yellow Lab](/en/labidochromis-caeruleus).

Avoid housing with aggressive species — the [Golden Mbuna](/en/melanochromis-auratus) or
[Zebra Mbuna](/en/pseudotropheus-zebra) will stress and dominate the peaceful Aulonocara. Do not keep multiple males
together in a small tank, as conflicts are inevitable. The ideal setup is a harem of one male with several females.

## Breeding

Like all Aulonocara, _Aulonocara sp. Orchid Red_ is a maternal mouthbrooder. The male clears a patch of sand or selects
a flat rock where he performs a courtship dance, showing off his vibrant coloration. After spawning, the female collects
the fertilized eggs in her mouth and incubates them for 18–21 days.

During incubation the female does not eat, so she should be well-fed before spawning. To improve fry survival, consider
moving the brooding female to a separate tank. The released fry are fairly large — starter foods include baby brine
shrimp and finely crushed flakes. Keep in mind that offspring of selectively bred forms may vary in coloration, and not
all fry will inherit the bright red color of their parents.
