## Overview

The Sparkling Gourami (Trichopsis pumila) is a small, peaceful species from the family Osphronemidae. Native to the
slow-moving waters of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, this fish is recognized for its
shimmering body and distinctive vocalizations, which it produces through specialized organs near its swim bladder.
Growing to a size of 3-4 cm, the Sparkling Gourami is an excellent choice for nano tanks or as a peaceful community fish
in larger aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Sparkling Gouramis thrive in well-planted aquariums with a minimum volume of 20 liters. They prefer warm water
temperatures between 24-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-12. The tank should
include plenty of hiding spots created by plants, driftwood, and leaf litter. Gentle filtration and subdued lighting
will help replicate their natural environment. A tight-fitting lid is recommended, as these fish are known to jump.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Sparkling Gouramis feed on small insects, larvae, and zooplankton. In an aquarium setting, they will
readily accept a variety of foods, including high-quality micro-pellets, finely crushed flake foods, and live or frozen
foods such as daphnia, brine shrimp, and bloodworms. To maintain their health and vibrant coloration, it is important to
provide a varied diet. Feed small amounts twice a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Sparkling Gouramis are relatively easy to care for, making them a good choice for both beginners and experienced
aquarists. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary to keep the water conditions stable. They are sensitive
to sudden changes in water parameters, so it’s important to maintain a stable environment. Monitor their health
regularly, especially looking for signs of stress or disease, and take action as needed.

## Compatibility

Sparkling Gouramis are peaceful fish that do well with other small, non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include
small tetras, rasboras, and corydoras. They can be kept in pairs or small groups but should be monitored for any signs
of aggression, especially during breeding. Avoid keeping them with larger or more aggressive fish that might outcompete
them for food or space.

## Breeding

Breeding Sparkling Gouramis in captivity can be achieved with the right conditions. They are bubble-nesters, and the
male will create a bubble nest at the water's surface, usually among floating plants. Spawning is often triggered by
slightly raising the water temperature and lowering the water level. Once the eggs are laid and fertilized, the male
will guard the nest until the fry hatch. The fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flakes once they become
free-swimming.
