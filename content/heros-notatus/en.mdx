## Overview

Heros notatus, commonly referred to as the Spotted Severum, is a large, peaceful cichlid native to South America,
particularly in slow-moving rivers and flooded forest areas. Known for its distinct spotted patterns on a golden to
greenish background, this species adds a touch of elegance to any aquarium. Spotted Severums are popular for their mild
temperament and compatibility with a variety of tankmates, making them suitable for community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

A spacious tank of at least 250 liters is recommended for Heros notatus due to their size and activity level. They
thrive in warm water with temperatures ranging from 24-28Â°C, a pH of 6.0-7.5, and water hardness (GH) of 5-15. Provide
plenty of hiding spots with driftwood, rocks, and hardy plants, as well as open swimming spaces. These fish appreciate a
soft substrate, mimicking their natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

Spotted Severums are omnivorous and have a diverse diet in the wild, feeding on plant material, small invertebrates, and
detritus. In captivity, they accept high-quality pellets, live and frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and
daphnia. Supplement their diet with vegetables like blanched spinach, zucchini, or peas to ensure proper nutrition and
maintain their vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Heros notatus requires moderate care, making it suitable for aquarists with some experience. Regular water changes
(25-30% weekly) are essential to maintain water quality and prevent stress. As they are sensitive to poor water
conditions, maintaining stable parameters is critical. Provide enrichment by rearranging tank decor occasionally to keep
them engaged and reduce territorial disputes.

## Compatibility

Spotted Severums are generally peaceful but may show mild territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They can
coexist with other calm cichlids, medium-sized characins, and catfish such as Corydoras or plecos. Avoid housing them
with overly aggressive or much smaller fish to prevent stress or accidental predation. Ensure the tank is spacious
enough to accommodate all inhabitants comfortably.

## Breeding

Breeding Heros notatus is possible in captivity and typically involves pairing up compatible individuals. They are
substrate spawners, with females laying eggs on flat surfaces such as rocks or broad plant leaves. Both parents take
part in guarding and caring for the eggs and fry. Ensure a separate breeding tank or a well-monitored environment, as
their protective nature may lead to increased aggression toward tankmates.
