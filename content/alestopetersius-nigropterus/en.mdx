## Overview

The Blackfin Congo Tetra, _Alestopetersius nigropterus_, is a vibrant and active tetra from the Alestidae family, native
to the Congo River basin in Africa. This species is characterized by its shimmering, iridescent scales that flash with
blue, green, and gold, and the distinct black edging on its dorsal and anal fins. Males are typically more colorful and
develop the impressive, flowing fin extensions that are characteristic of the Congo tetra group. They are a shoaling
species that will bring a great deal of activity and beauty to a well-maintained aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

A school of 6-8 Blackfin Congo Tetras should be housed in at least a 30-gallon (120 liters) aquarium to provide ample
swimming space. They prefer a setup that mimics their natural habitat: a well-planted tank with a dark substrate, plenty
of driftwood, and open areas for swimming. Dim lighting will enhance their colors and make them feel more secure.

Water conditions should be soft and acidic, with a temperature range of 75-81°F (24-27°C), a pH of 6.0-7.0, and a
hardness of 2-10 dGH. They are sensitive to water quality, so excellent filtration and regular water changes are
essential.

## Feeding and Diet

Blackfin Congo Tetras are omnivores and should be fed a varied diet to maintain their health and vitality. A
high-quality flake food or micropellet can be used as a staple, but it is important to supplement this with live and
frozen foods such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. This will help to bring out their best coloration and
encourage spawning behavior.

## Care and Maintenance

This species requires a commitment to maintaining pristine water conditions. Weekly water changes of 30-50% are
recommended. They are a peaceful shoaling fish and must be kept in groups of at least 6, with larger groups being
preferable. In a larger school, they will be more confident, their colors will be more vibrant, and their interesting
social behaviors will be more apparent. They can be skittish, so a calm environment is important.

## Compatibility

The Blackfin Congo Tetra is a great choice for a peaceful community aquarium. They should be kept with other fish of a
similar size and temperament. Good tankmates include other African tetras, such as the
[Yellow-Tail Congo Tetra](/en/alestopetersius-caudalis), dwarf cichlids like those from the _Pelvicachromis_ genus, and
various catfish and loaches. Avoid housing them with large, aggressive, or overly boisterous fish.

## Breeding

Breeding the Blackfin Congo Tetra is possible but can be challenging. A dedicated breeding tank with very soft, acidic
water is required. The tank should be dimly lit and contain clumps of fine-leaved plants like Java moss or a spawning
mop. The fish should be conditioned with plenty of live and frozen foods. They are egg-scatterers and will eat their own
eggs, so the parents should be removed after spawning. The eggs hatch in about 36 hours, and the fry will need to be fed
infusoria or other microscopic foods for the first few days.
