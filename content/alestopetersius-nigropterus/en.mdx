## Overview

Alestopetersius nigropterus, commonly known as the Blackfin Alestopetersius or Blackfin Tetra, is a small and peaceful
freshwater fish from the rivers of Central Africa. It is characterized by its silver body and distinctive black markings
on its fins. Growing to about 5-6 cm in length, this fish is an excellent addition to a community aquarium, especially
one that replicates its natural habitat with plenty of plants and open swimming spaces.

## Tank Requirements

The Blackfin Alestopetersius thrives in a well-maintained aquarium of at least 60 liters. The tank should have a
temperature range of 23-27°C, a pH of 6.0-7.5, and a general hardness (GH) of 4-12 dGH. A planted aquarium with subdued
lighting and plenty of hiding spots will help the fish feel secure. A gentle water flow mimicking their natural river
habitat is recommended, and regular water changes are essential to keep the water quality high.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Alestopetersius nigropterus is omnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates, plant matter, and algae. In
captivity, they will accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flake foods, micro-pellets, and frozen or live
foods like brine shrimp and daphnia. It is important to provide a balanced diet to maintain their health and vibrant
coloration. Feed them small portions 2-3 times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Blackfin Alestopetersius is relatively easy, making it suitable for aquarists of all experience levels.
Regular water changes of 25-30% per week are recommended to maintain optimal water quality. Ensure the tank has
sufficient plants and hiding spots to reduce stress and aggression. Monitor water parameters regularly, as this species
is sensitive to poor water conditions.

## Compatibility

The Blackfin Alestopetersius is a peaceful fish that does well in a community aquarium with other small, non-aggressive
species. Ideal tank mates include other small tetras, rasboras, and peaceful bottom-dwellers like Corydoras. Avoid
keeping them with larger, aggressive fish that may prey on them or cause stress.

## Breeding

Breeding Alestopetersius nigropterus in captivity can be challenging, but it is possible with the right conditions. A
separate breeding tank with slightly acidic water (pH around 6.5) and a temperature of 25-27°C is recommended. The fish
are egg scatterers, and the eggs should be protected from being eaten by the parents by using a spawning mop or
fine-leaved plants. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in
24-36 hours, and the fry should be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food until they are large enough to accept
larger foods.
