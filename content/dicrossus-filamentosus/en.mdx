## Overview

**Dicrossus filamentosus**, commonly referred to as the Checkerboard Cichlid or Chessboard Cichlid, is a small, delicate
fish belonging to the Cichlidae family. Originating from slow-moving, soft, and acidic waters in the Amazon Basin of
South America, this species is well known for its unique checkerboard patterning and elongated fin rays, which make it a
favorite among aquarists who appreciate its understated beauty. Males are generally more colorful and have longer fin
extensions, while females are smaller and less vibrant.

## Tank Requirements

The Checkerboard Cichlid requires a well-maintained aquarium of at least 60 liters (about 16 gallons) with plenty of
hiding spots, such as plants, driftwood, and leaf litter. The ideal water temperature for this species is between
24-28°C (75-82°F), with a pH range of 4.5-6.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 2-8. They thrive in soft, slightly acidic
water conditions that mimic their natural habitat. A soft substrate like sand is recommended to prevent damage to their
delicate barbels when foraging for food. Ensure gentle water flow to replicate their native slow-moving waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Dicrossus filamentosus** primarily feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and detritus. In an
aquarium setting, they should be offered a varied diet consisting of high-quality flakes or micro-pellets designed for
small carnivorous fish. Supplement their diet with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms to
provide essential nutrients and maintain their health and coloration. Feeding small amounts 2-3 times a day is ideal to
ensure they receive adequate nutrition without overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care and maintenance are crucial for the health of Checkerboard Cichlids. Perform weekly water changes of 20-30%
to maintain optimal water quality, and ensure the tank is equipped with an efficient filtration system that does not
create a strong current. These fish are sensitive to poor water conditions and sudden changes in parameters, so
consistent monitoring of water quality is essential. Regularly check for signs of stress or disease, such as loss of
color, rapid breathing, or clamped fins, and address any issues promptly to prevent the spread of illness.

## Compatibility

Checkerboard Cichlids are relatively peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive species that share
similar water requirements. Ideal tank mates include small tetras, rasboras, and dwarf catfish like Corydoras species.
Avoid keeping them with larger, more aggressive fish that may bully them. It is best to keep them in pairs or small
groups with a clear social structure to minimize aggression and stress, especially during breeding periods.

## Breeding

Breeding **Dicrossus filamentosus** in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. These cichlids are substrate spawners
and often lay their eggs on flat surfaces or within leaf litter. To encourage breeding, provide a separate breeding tank
with soft, acidic water and a temperature slightly higher than the main tank (around 26-28°C). Once a pair forms, the
female will lay eggs on a chosen surface, which both parents will guard fiercely. After hatching, the fry can be fed
with infusoria or other small, live foods until they are large enough to consume crushed flakes or micro-pellets.
Parental care is typical, but it’s crucial to monitor for any signs of stress or aggression.
