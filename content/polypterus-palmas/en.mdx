## Overview

Polypterus palmas, commonly known as the West African Bichir, is a species of bichir native to the slow-moving rivers
and swamps of West Africa. This fascinating fish belongs to the family Polypteridae and is known for its elongated body,
multiple dorsal finlets, and its ability to breathe atmospheric air through a specialized lung-like organ. Polypterus
palmas can grow up to 30-35 cm in length and has a lifespan of 15-20 years when kept in optimal conditions. Its
prehistoric appearance and nocturnal habits make it a popular choice for experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Polypterus palmas requires a spacious tank of at least 200 liters due to its size and activity level. The water
temperature should be maintained between 24-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-20. A
soft substrate like sand or fine gravel is recommended, along with plenty of hiding spots such as caves, driftwood, and
dense vegetation. The tank should be equipped with a secure lid to prevent the fish from escaping, as Polypterus palmas
is known for its ability to jump. Dim lighting is preferred, mimicking the fish's natural habitat in murky, slow-moving
waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Polypterus palmas is a carnivorous predator that feeds on smaller fish, crustaceans, and insects. In
captivity, it should be fed a varied diet of high-quality frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, shrimp, and small
fish. It can also be trained to accept sinking pellets designed for carnivorous fish. Feeding should take place in the
evening or at night, aligning with its natural nocturnal behavior. Ensure that food reaches the bottom of the tank,
where Polypterus palmas typically feeds.

## Care and Maintenance

Polypterus palmas is relatively hardy but requires specific care to thrive. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
essential to maintain water quality. Due to its ability to breathe air, ensure that it can easily access the water
surface. Keep the tank covered to prevent escapes, and monitor water parameters regularly to avoid sudden changes in
water chemistry. Polypterus palmas is prone to common fish diseases, so maintaining a clean environment and providing a
balanced diet are key to keeping it healthy.

## Compatibility

Polypterus palmas is generally peaceful but should not be kept with very small fish, as it may view them as prey.
Suitable tank mates include other large, non-aggressive species such as larger catfish, cichlids, and larger characins.
Avoid keeping it with fin-nipping species or very aggressive fish, as Polypterus palmas has delicate fins that can
easily be damaged. Ensure that tank mates are not small enough to be eaten and share similar water parameter
requirements.

## Breeding

Breeding Polypterus palmas in captivity is rare and difficult, largely due to its specific breeding requirements. In the
wild, Polypterus palmas spawns during the rainy season, laying eggs in dense vegetation. To replicate these conditions
in an aquarium, provide a large, heavily planted tank with a slightly lowered water level. Condition the fish with a
diet rich in live foods. If successful, the female will scatter eggs, which should be collected and transferred to a
separate breeding tank to prevent them from being eaten. The eggs will hatch within a few days, and the fry can be fed
infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
