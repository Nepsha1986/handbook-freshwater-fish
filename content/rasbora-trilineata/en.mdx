## Overview

**Rasbora trilineata**, commonly called the **Scissortail Rasbora**, is a medium-sized freshwater fish found in
Southeast Asia, particularly in rivers and lakes of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Known for its distinctive forked
tail, which resembles a pair of scissors in motion, this fish can grow up to 12 cm in length. Its sleek silver body and
black line running from head to tail make it a popular choice for community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Scissortail Rasboras are active swimmers that require a spacious tank, with a minimum size of 100 liters. These fish
thrive in water temperatures between 24-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-12. The tank
should be well-aerated with a moderate flow, as they enjoy swimming against currents. A combination of open swimming
areas and plants for occasional shelter is ideal.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Rasbora trilineata** feeds on small invertebrates and insects. In aquariums, they will readily accept a
variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, pellets, and live or frozen options like daphnia, bloodworms, and brine
shrimp. To keep them healthy, offer a varied diet and feed them 1-2 times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Rasbora trilineata is relatively easy to care for, as long as their water quality is maintained. Weekly water changes of
20-30% are recommended, and a good filtration system will help keep the water clean. These fish are not overly sensitive
to water parameters, making them suitable for intermediate aquarists. Be sure to provide a covered tank, as they are
known to jump when startled.

## Compatibility

Scissortail Rasboras are peaceful and get along well with other community fish. They do best when kept in groups of at
least six, as they are a schooling species. Suitable tankmates include tetras, gouramis, and other similarly sized,
peaceful fish. Avoid keeping them with aggressive species or fin-nippers, as they may become stressed.

## Breeding

Breeding **Rasbora trilineata** in captivity is moderately challenging. They are egg scatterers, and spawning can be
induced by gradually raising the water temperature to around 26-28°C. Provide a separate breeding tank with soft,
slightly acidic water, and use fine-leaved plants for the eggs to adhere to. The eggs will hatch in about 24-36 hours,
and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food initially, before transitioning to larger foods like baby brine
shrimp as they grow.
