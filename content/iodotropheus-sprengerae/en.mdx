## Overview

**Iodotropheus sprengerae**, commonly known as the Rusty Cichlid, is a smaller and more peaceful mbuna species from Lake
Malawi. It is a great choice for community setups with other cichlids due to its mild temperament. Named for its
distinctive rust-colored scales, it adds a beautiful hue to any aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

To house Iodotropheus sprengerae, an aquarium of at least 100 liters is recommended. Provide plenty of rocky caves and
hiding places to replicate its natural habitat. The water temperature should be maintained between 23-28Â°C, with a pH
range of 7.5-8.5 and a hardness of 10-20 dGH. A good filtration system and regular water changes are essential for the
species' well-being.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Rusty Cichlids primarily graze on algae and small invertebrates. In captivity, a diet consisting of
high-quality spirulina-based flakes, vegetable matter, and occasional protein-rich foods like brine shrimp will keep
them healthy. Avoid excessive protein to prevent bloating.

## Care and Maintenance

Rusty Cichlids are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water changes
(20-25% weekly) and monitoring water parameters are essential. These cichlids are less aggressive than most mbuna
species, but occasional territorial disputes may occur, especially during breeding.

## Compatibility

This species is semi-aggressive but generally more peaceful than other mbuna cichlids. It can coexist with similarly
sized cichlids and other Lake Malawi species. Avoid keeping them with highly aggressive fish. A ratio of one male to
multiple females is recommended to minimize aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Rusty Cichlids is relatively straightforward in the right conditions. The male will create a territory in a
rocky area and court females to spawn. The female incubates the eggs in her mouth for 18-21 days before releasing the
fry. Feed the fry finely crushed spirulina flakes or baby brine shrimp.
