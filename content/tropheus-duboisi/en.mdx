## Overview

The Duboisi Cichlid (Tropheus duboisi) is a fascinating species of cichlid native to Lake Tanganyika in East Africa.
Known for their distinctive white spots as juveniles, these fish undergo a dramatic transformation as they mature,
developing a darker, more uniform color. Growing to a size of 10-12 cm, Duboisi Cichlids are known for their unique
social behavior and are best kept in groups to reduce aggression. Their natural habitat consists of rocky shorelines,
where they graze on algae.

## Tank Requirements

Duboisi Cichlids require a spacious and well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 200 liters. The ideal water
temperature should be between 24-28°C, with a pH level ranging from 7.8 to 9.0 and water hardness (GH) between 10-20.
They thrive in a tank with plenty of rocks and caves to mimic their natural habitat and to provide hiding spots. The
tank should be equipped with a powerful filter to maintain water quality and ensure a stable environment for the fish.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Duboisi Cichlids primarily feed on algae and small invertebrates. In captivity, their diet should consist
of high-quality vegetable-based foods, such as spirulina flakes or pellets, along with occasional protein sources like
brine shrimp or bloodworms. It's important to avoid high-protein foods that can lead to digestive issues. Feed them 2-3
times a day in small amounts to prevent overeating and maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Duboisi Cichlids require regular care to ensure their health and well-being. Perform weekly water changes of 20-30% to
maintain optimal water conditions. Regularly clean the tank and monitor the water parameters to prevent stress and
disease. Because they are susceptible to bloat, a common health issue in cichlids, it's crucial to monitor their diet
and avoid overfeeding. Providing a stable and stress-free environment will help prevent health problems.

## Compatibility

Duboisi Cichlids can be territorial, especially during breeding, but they are generally compatible with other species of
similar size and temperament. It's recommended to keep them in groups of at least 8-10 individuals to spread out
aggression. Suitable tank mates include other Tanganyikan cichlids or species that inhabit similar environments. Avoid
keeping them with more aggressive or significantly larger fish to prevent conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding Duboisi Cichlids in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. These fish are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning
the female carries the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, maintain slightly warmer water
temperatures around 26-28°C and provide plenty of hiding spots. Once the fry are released, they should be fed with
finely crushed spirulina flakes or baby brine shrimp. It's important to separate the fry from adult fish to prevent them
from being eaten.
