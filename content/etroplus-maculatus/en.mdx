## Overview

Etroplus maculatus, commonly known as the Spotted Cichlid or Orange Chromide, is a striking freshwater fish from the
Cichlidae family. Native to India and Sri Lanka, it is known for its bright orange coloration and characteristic spots.
This species prefers slow-moving waters with abundant vegetation, typically found in rivers and lakes in its natural
habitat.

## Tank Requirements

To ensure the best living conditions for Etroplus maculatus, a minimum tank size of 100 liters is recommended. The water
temperature should be maintained between 24-28Â°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 10-20. It
is essential to provide appropriate filtration to maintain water quality, as well as some submerged vegetation and rocks
for hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Etroplus maculatus feeds on algae, small invertebrates, and plant matter. In captivity, it can be fed a
balanced diet consisting of high-quality flakes, pellets, and occasional live or frozen foods like daphnia or brine
shrimp. To keep the fish healthy, it is recommended to feed them 2-3 times a day, ensuring they have access to a varied
diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Etroplus maculatus is relatively easy to care for, though regular water changes (around 25% weekly) are essential for
maintaining a healthy environment. A gentle filtration system is preferred, as strong currents may stress the fish.
Monitoring water parameters, including temperature and pH, is crucial for their well-being. Common health issues include
fungal infections or fin rot, which can be prevented with proper tank maintenance and water quality.

## Compatibility

This species is generally peaceful but may display territorial behavior, especially during the breeding season. Etroplus
maculatus can be kept with other peaceful community fish of similar size. However, it is best to avoid keeping them with
overly aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include tetras, gouramis, and other non-aggressive cichlids.

## Breeding

Breeding Etroplus maculatus in captivity is moderately easy. They require a well-planted tank with plenty of hiding
spaces. Mating pairs will often clean a flat surface to lay their eggs. The female can lay up to 200 eggs, which will
hatch in 3-4 days. The fry should be fed infusoria or finely crushed food until they grow large enough to accept larger
foods. Provide a separate breeding tank if needed to protect the young from other fish.
