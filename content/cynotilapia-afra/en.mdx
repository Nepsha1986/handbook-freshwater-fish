## Overview

The Afra Cichlid (_Cynotilapia afra_) is a striking and colorful species native to the rocky shores of Lake Malawi in
East Africa. Known for its deep blues and bold stripes, this species is particularly popular among cichlid enthusiasts
for its territorial nature and active behavior. Afra Cichlids are relatively small compared to other cichlids but
require specific water parameters and a well-maintained environment.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 150 liters is recommended for Afra Cichlids, with water temperatures between 24-28Â°C, a pH level
of 7.8-8.6, and general hardness (GH) between 10-20. They thrive in tanks with rocky setups that mimic their natural
environment, providing caves and crevices for hiding and establishing territories. Strong filtration and regular water
changes are essential to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

Afra Cichlids are omnivorous, feeding on algae, small invertebrates, and plankton in the wild. In the aquarium, a
balanced diet of quality cichlid pellets, spirulina-based flakes, and occasional live or frozen foods like brine shrimp
or bloodworms will keep them healthy. Avoid feeding them high-protein foods like beef heart, which can be difficult for
them to digest.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is relatively hardy but requires a well-maintained tank to prevent stress and disease. Weekly water changes
of 20-30% and careful monitoring of water parameters are crucial. Afra Cichlids are prone to common cichlid diseases if
the water quality declines, so regular cleaning and tank upkeep are essential.

## Compatibility

Afra Cichlids are semi-aggressive and territorial, especially during breeding periods. They can be kept with other
species of similar size and temperament, particularly other African cichlids from Lake Malawi. Avoid keeping them with
overly aggressive species or peaceful fish that may become targets of bullying.

## Breeding

Breeding _Cynotilapia afra_ in captivity is possible with the right setup.
