## Overview

**Platydoras costatus**, commonly known as the Striped Raphael Catfish or Talking Catfish, belongs to the Doradidae
family. Native to the slow-moving waters of the Amazon Basin, these fish are prized for their distinctive striped
appearance and their ability to produce croaking sounds when handled.

They can reach lengths of 15-20 cm and are known for their hardy, peaceful nature, making them well-suited for community
aquariums. **Platydoras costatus** is nocturnal and prefers dimly lit or shaded areas with plenty of hiding spaces.

## Tank Requirements

Striped Raphael Catfish require a tank with a capacity of at least 150 liters to accommodate their size and to provide
them with enough room to move around comfortably. Ideal water conditions include temperatures between 22-28Â°C, a pH
range of 6.0-7.5, and a GH of 4-18.

A well-decorated aquarium with hiding spots such as caves, driftwood, and dense plants will help mimic their natural
habitat. Since they are nocturnal, low lighting or subdued lighting at night is recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

**Platydoras costatus** are omnivores and enjoy a varied diet consisting of sinking pellets, algae wafers, live or
frozen foods like bloodworms, and occasional vegetables such as cucumber or zucchini. Being bottom dwellers, they prefer
food that sinks to the substrate, where they will actively scavenge.

Their diet should be balanced to ensure they remain healthy, and any uneaten food should be removed to prevent water
quality issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Striped Raphael Catfish are hardy and relatively easy to care for. However, they require stable water conditions and
proper filtration, as they are sensitive to poor water quality. Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) are recommended to
maintain optimal conditions.

As nocturnal fish, they spend much of their daytime hiding. Providing plenty of shelters will reduce stress and help
them feel secure. Though peaceful, they are armored and can defend themselves if harassed.

## Compatibility

**Platydoras costatus** are peaceful and can be housed with other non-aggressive tank mates. They are compatible with
larger tetras, peaceful cichlids, and other medium to large peaceful fish species. Avoid housing them with very small
fish that may be mistaken for food during night-time scavenging.

## Breeding

Breeding **Platydoras costatus** in captivity is rare and difficult. They are egg-layers, but successful spawning
usually requires specific water conditions and may occur only in very large tanks. There is little documented success of
breeding these catfish in home aquariums.
