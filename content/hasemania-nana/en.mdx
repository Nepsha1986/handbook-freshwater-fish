## Overview

The Silver-Tipped Tetra (_Hasemania nana_) is a small, active fish from the Characidae family, originating from South
America, primarily in Brazil. Known for its distinctive silvery tips on its fins and vibrant gold coloration, this tetra
is a popular choice for community aquariums. Its peaceful nature and schooling behavior make it an excellent addition to
tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

Silver-Tipped Tetras require a minimum tank size of 60 liters with a temperature range of 22-28Â°C, a pH of 6.0-7.5, and
a GH of 5-15. They thrive in a well-planted tank with subdued lighting and plenty of open space for swimming. Adding
driftwood and leaf litter can help recreate their natural habitat, as well as provide tannins in the water.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Silver-Tipped Tetras are omnivores, feeding on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In captivity,
they do well with a varied diet of high-quality flakes, micro-pellets, and occasional treats of frozen or live foods
like brine shrimp and daphnia. Providing a balanced diet will keep them healthy and enhance their colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining good water quality is essential for Silver-Tipped Tetras. Weekly water changes of around 20-30% are
recommended to keep the water parameters stable. Regular monitoring of pH and temperature is also advised, as these fish
are sensitive to sudden changes in water conditions.

## Compatibility

Silver-Tipped Tetras are peaceful, schooling fish that thrive in groups of at least six or more. They are compatible
with other small, non-aggressive fish like neon tetras, rasboras, and small corydoras catfish. Avoid keeping them with
larger, aggressive species that may intimidate or harm them.

## Breeding

Breeding Silver-Tipped Tetras in captivity is possible, although they require specific conditions. A separate breeding
tank with softer water, slightly acidic pH, and dim lighting will increase the chances of successful spawning. The
female scatters eggs, which the parents may eat, so removing the adults after spawning can help protect the eggs.
