## Overview

**Thorichthys aureus**, commonly known as the **Gold Firemouth** or **Blue Flash Cichlid**, is a colorful cichlid
species native to Central American rivers. Known for its metallic blue body with golden highlights, this fish grows to a
length of 12-15 cm and can live for 10-12 years under optimal conditions. It is moderately aggressive but can be a
beautiful addition to a well-maintained community tank with appropriate tank mates.

## Tank Requirements

The **Gold Firemouth** thrives in a well-sized aquarium of at least 150 liters. The water temperature should be
maintained between 24-28Â°C with a pH range of 7.0-8.0 and water hardness (GH) of 8-15. The tank should have a sandy
substrate and plenty of hiding spots, such as rocks and driftwood, to help reduce territorial behavior. A strong
filtration system is essential to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Thorichthys aureus** feeds on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed a
balanced diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms or brine shrimp, and occasional
vegetable matter like blanched spinach or peas. Regular feeding 2-3 times a day is recommended, but avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

To maintain good water quality for **Gold Firemouth**, perform weekly water changes of around 25%. Keep an eye on water
parameters, as this species is sensitive to poor conditions. Ensure that there are enough hiding spots and territories
within the tank to minimize aggression between tank mates.

## Compatibility

**Thorichthys aureus** is moderately aggressive, particularly when defending its territory or during breeding. It can be
housed with other Central American cichlids or similarly sized fish with peaceful to semi-aggressive temperaments. Avoid
small or overly aggressive fish, as they may either be bullied or provoke aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Thorichthys aureus** is relatively easy. They are substrate spawners and tend to form monogamous pairs. To
encourage breeding, maintain clean water and offer a varied diet. Once the eggs are laid, both parents guard the nest
and care for the fry. The fry can be fed specialized fry food or crushed flakes once they become free-swimming.
