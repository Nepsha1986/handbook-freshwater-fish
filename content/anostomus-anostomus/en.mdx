## Overview

_Anostomus anostomus_, or the Striped Headstander, is one of the most recognizable fish in the Anostomidae family. This
species originates from the Amazon and Orinoco river basins, where it inhabits fast-flowing waters among rocks and
driftwood. It is found in Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Peru.

The body is elongated and cigar-shaped, reaching 15–18 cm in length. The base coloration is dark brown with three vivid
yellow horizontal stripes running along the body. The dorsal fin and caudal peduncle are red, while the anal and pelvic
fins also display red highlights. The head is pointed with an upturned mouth.

The most distinctive feature of this species is its characteristic head-down swimming posture, which gives it the common
name Headstander. In the wild, this posture helps the fish scrape algae from rocks and driftwood. With proper care, the
Striped Headstander can live 5–10 years.

## Tank Requirements

_Anostomus anostomus_ requires an aquarium of at least 250 liters. This is an active, fast-swimming fish, so tank length
is important — a minimum of 120 cm is recommended.

Optimal water parameters:

- Temperature: 23–27 °C
- pH: 6.0–7.5
- General hardness (GH): 5–12

The aquarium setup should replicate the natural habitat: sandy or fine gravel substrate, large rocks, driftwood, and
open swimming space. Choose hardy-leaved plants such as Anubias, Echinodorus, and Java fern, as the fish may damage soft
vegetation. Bright lighting encourages algae growth on decorations, providing an additional food source.

A tight-fitting lid is essential — Striped Headstanders are excellent jumpers. Filtration should be powerful, creating
moderate current to simulate river conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Anostomus anostomus_ feeds on algae growth, plant detritus, and small invertebrates. In the aquarium, the
diet should be primarily plant-based:

- Spirulina flakes and granules
- Algae wafers
- Blanched vegetables: spinach, zucchini, cucumber, lettuce

Animal-based supplements are also necessary for complete nutrition:

- Bloodworms (live or frozen)
- Brine shrimp
- Daphnia

Feed once or twice daily in small portions. If the fish begin nibbling on aquarium plants, it is a sign that the
vegetable component of their diet is insufficient.

## Care and Maintenance

_Anostomus anostomus_ is a fish for experienced aquarists. Weekly water changes of 20–25% are mandatory. Test water
parameters regularly, paying close attention to nitrate levels and pH.

Striped Headstanders can be territorial, particularly toward conspecifics and fish with similar body shapes. The best
approach is to keep either a single specimen or a group of 8 or more. In groups of 2–5, the dominant individual will
harass the others. In a larger school, aggression is distributed evenly and causes no serious harm.

Monitor the fish closely: stressed individuals will lose color and hide. Provide ample hiding spots using rocks and
driftwood so subordinate fish can find shelter.

## Compatibility

The Striped Headstander is a semi-aggressive species that requires careful selection of tank mates. Good companions
include:

- Medium to large [tetras](/en/phenacogrammus-interruptus) such as the Congo tetra
- [Angelfish](/en/pterophyllum-scalare) and other peaceful medium-sized cichlids
- [Severums](/en/heros-severus)
- Large [Corydoras](/en/corydoras-sterbai) and [Bristlenose plecos](/en/ancistrus-cirrhosus)
- Medium-sized [barbs](/en/puntius-tetrazona)

Unsuitable tank mates include:

- Small fish that may be eaten
- Slow-moving species with long fins
- Other Anostomidae members in a confined tank, such as [Leporinus](/en/leporinus-fasciatus), as conflicts may arise
  between them

## Breeding

Breeding _Anostomus anostomus_ in a home aquarium is extremely challenging, with successful cases being rare. Commercial
breeding takes place in South America and Asia, but the specific methods remain largely undocumented.

Sexual dimorphism is subtle: females are slightly larger and fuller than males, especially when ready to spawn.

To stimulate spawning, the following approach is recommended:

- Separate males and females and condition them with generous live food for 2–3 weeks
- Prepare a large spawning tank with sandy substrate, algae-covered rocks, and peat filtration
- Gradually raise the temperature by 2–3 degrees and darken the aquarium
- Ensure soft, acidic water

Eggs are scattered among plants. After spawning, the parents should be removed immediately, as they will consume the
eggs. The majority of fish available in the trade are wild-caught, underscoring the difficulty of breeding this species.
