## Overview

Anostomus anostomus, also known as the Striped Headstander or simply Anostomus, is a captivating freshwater fish native
to the rivers of South America. This species is easily recognized by its elongated body, vibrant golden-yellow
coloration, and three bold, horizontal black stripes running along its length. The Striped Headstander gets its name
from its unique head-down swimming posture, which is characteristic of the species. Growing up to 15-18 cm in length,
this fish is active, hardy, and best suited for spacious, well-maintained aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

The Striped Headstander requires a large tank of at least 250 liters to accommodate its active swimming habits. The
water temperature should be maintained between 23-27Â°C, with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and general hardness (GH) of 5-12. The tank
should be well-planted with sturdy plants, as this species may nibble on delicate vegetation. Providing ample swimming
space and some hiding spots using rocks, driftwood, or other decorations is essential to reduce stress and aggression. A
strong filtration system and regular water changes are necessary to maintain high water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Anostomus anostomus feeds primarily on algae, plant matter, and small invertebrates. In an aquarium
setting, it should be offered a diet rich in vegetable matter, including spirulina flakes, algae wafers, and blanched
vegetables like spinach and zucchini. Occasionally, supplement their diet with live or frozen foods such as bloodworms,
brine shrimp, and daphnia to ensure balanced nutrition. Feeding should be done once or twice daily, and uneaten food
should be removed to maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Anostomus anostomus involves maintaining stable water conditions and monitoring its behavior. Regular water
changes of 20-25% weekly are essential to ensure optimal water quality. This species can be territorial, especially
towards other fish with similar body shapes, so providing enough space and hiding spots is crucial to minimize
conflicts. A well-secured tank cover is recommended, as the Striped Headstander is an agile jumper. Watch for signs of
stress or illness, and address any issues promptly.

## Compatibility

The Striped Headstander can be semi-aggressive, particularly towards similar-looking species. It is best kept with other
robust, fast-moving fish that can tolerate its occasional territorial behavior. Suitable tank mates include larger
tetras, barbs, and peaceful cichlids. Avoid keeping them with small, slow-moving, or long-finned fish, as they may
become targets of aggression. Keeping a group of Striped Headstanders together can help disperse aggression, but the
tank should be large enough to provide ample space for all individuals.

## Breeding

Breeding Anostomus anostomus in captivity is extremely challenging and rarely achieved. This species requires specific
environmental conditions that are difficult to replicate in a home aquarium. If breeding is attempted, a large, heavily
planted tank with soft, acidic water and strong filtration is recommended. The breeding pair should be well-conditioned
with a varied diet, including plenty of live and frozen foods. Eggs are usually scattered among plants, and removing the
parents after spawning is advisable to prevent egg predation. Due to the difficulty in breeding this species, most
available specimens are wild-caught.
