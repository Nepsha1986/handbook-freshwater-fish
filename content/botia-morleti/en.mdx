## Overview

The Morlet's Loach (_Botia morleti_) is a member of the Botiidae family, native to Southeast Asia. This colorful and
peaceful fish can grow up to 20 cm in length and is well known for its playful nature. It thrives in warm, slightly
acidic water and is best kept in a larger aquarium with plenty of hiding places. Morlet's Loach is often recommended for
experienced aquarium keepers due to its moderate care requirements.

## Tank Requirements

Morlet's Loach prefers a tank of at least 100 liters, with water temperature ranging from 24-28°C. The water should have
a slightly acidic to neutral pH of 6.5-7.5, and moderate hardness (GH 8-15). Providing hiding spots such as rocks,
driftwood, and dense plants is essential, as these fish enjoy exploring and having places to retreat to. A
well-maintained filtration system is also recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

Morlet's Loach is omnivorous and will accept a wide range of foods, including sinking pellets, flakes, live food (like
worms and shrimp), and frozen foods. They also scavenge for detritus, helping to keep the tank clean. It's important to
provide a varied diet to keep the loach healthy and prevent it from becoming bored or stressed.

## Care and Maintenance

These loaches are relatively hardy but require regular maintenance. Weekly water changes are important to maintain
optimal water quality. Additionally, they can be sensitive to sudden changes in water parameters, so stability is key.
Keep an eye on the fish’s health, and make sure they have plenty of room to swim, as they are quite active.

## Compatibility

Morlet's Loach is generally peaceful but can sometimes be territorial with other loaches or similarly shaped fish. It is
best kept with other peaceful species like tetras, gouramis, or peaceful barbs. Avoid aggressive species, as Morlet's
Loach prefers calm environments. It is also important to keep them in groups, as they are social fish.

## Breeding

Breeding Morlet's Loach in captivity is challenging. They are egg scatterers, but replicating their natural breeding
conditions can be difficult in home aquariums. If they do breed, the eggs will hatch in a few days, and the fry will
require a separate tank with very fine food like infusoria. It's recommended to separate the adults after breeding to
prevent them from eating the eggs or fry.
