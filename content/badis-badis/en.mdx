## Introduction

**Badis badis**, commonly known as the Dwarf Chameleon Fish or simply Badis, is a miniature member of the Badidae
family. This fish captivates aquarists with its ability to change colors depending on its mood, environment, and even
time of day. Native to South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal), Badis badis inhabits slow-moving rivers and streams with
dense vegetation.

The size of Badis badis usually does not exceed 5-6 cm, making it ideal for small aquariums. Its lifespan in captivity
is 3-5 years with proper care.

## Species Highlights

### Appearance

Badis badis is a true chameleon among fish. Its coloration can range from gray-blue to dark blue, red, or even almost
black, depending on its mood and environment. Males are typically brighter and larger than females, with more pronounced
fins.

### Behavior

Badis are calm and somewhat shy fish that love to hide among plants and decorations. They are territorial, especially
males, which can show aggression toward other males of their species.

## Aquarium Setup

### Water Parameters

- **Temperature:** 20-26°C
- **pH:** 6.0-7.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 5-12 dGH

### Tank Setup

1. **Tank Size:** From 40 liters for a pair or small group.
2. **Substrate:** Fine sand or smooth gravel.
3. **Plants:** Dense plant cover, such as Java moss, Anubias, or Cryptocoryne.
4. **Hiding Spots:** Driftwood, rocks, coconut shells, and caves.

**Tip:** Use dim lighting to create a comfortable environment for Badis.

## Feeding

Badis badis is a predator that feeds on small invertebrates in the wild. In an aquarium, their diet should include:

- **Staple Food:** Live or frozen foods (bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia).
- **Supplemental Foods:** Small pellets or flakes for carnivorous fish.
- **Feeding Frequency:** 1-2 times daily.

**Important:** Badis may refuse dry food, so live or frozen foods are preferred.

## Compatibility

Badis badis is a peaceful but territorial fish. Ideal tank mates include:

- **Small Tetras**.
- **Rasboras**.
- **Peaceful Bottom-Dwellers** (e.g., Corydoras).

**Avoid:** Keeping them with aggressive or overly active fish, such as barbs or large cichlids.

## Breeding

Breeding Badis badis in captivity is an interesting process:

1. **Breeding Tank:** A separate tank of 20-30 liters with soft substrate and hiding spots.
2. **Water Parameters:** Temperature 24-26°C, pH 6.5-7.0, soft water.
3. **Spawning Triggers:** Frequent water changes and increased live food.
4. **Spawning:** The female lays eggs in hiding spots, and the male guards the clutch.
5. **Fry Care:** Fry hatch in 2-3 days. Feed them infusoria or baby brine shrimp.

**Tip:** For successful breeding, keep one male with several females.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Loss of Activity:**

- Check water parameters (temperature, pH, ammonia).
- Ensure the fish are not stressed by aggressive tank mates.

2. **Refusal to Eat:**

- Offer live or frozen foods.
- Ensure the food reaches the bottom.

3. **Aggression Between Males:**

- Increase the number of hiding spots.
- Keep only one male in a small aquarium.

## Conclusion

Badis badis is a unique fish that will become a true gem in your aquarium. Its ability to change colors, peaceful
nature, and fascinating behavior make it an excellent choice for small aquarium enthusiasts. Provide it with the right
environment, and it will reward you with its beauty and activity for years to come!
