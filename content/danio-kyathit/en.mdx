## Overview

The Kyathit Danio (Danio kyathit) is a small, vibrant fish native to the rivers of Myanmar. Recognized for its striking
colors and active daytime behavior, this species is a popular choice for community aquariums. Typically reaching a size
of 4-6 cm, Kyathit Danio is known for its peaceful nature and compatibility with other small, non-aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

Kyathit Danios thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 80 liters. The ideal water temperature
should be between 22-26°C, with a pH level ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 5-10. They prefer a
tank setup with plenty of swimming space and gentle filtration. Including some plants and hiding spots will help
replicate their natural environment and provide a comfortable habitat. Regular water changes and good water quality are
essential for their health.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Kyathit Danios feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they should be offered a varied
diet including high-quality flake foods, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp, and some vegetable
matter. A balanced diet will help maintain their vibrant colors and overall health. Feed them once or twice a day,
avoiding overfeeding to prevent water quality issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care is important to keep Kyathit Danios healthy. Perform weekly water changes of 20-25% to maintain water
quality. Ensure the tank environment mimics their natural habitat with plenty of open swimming space and gentle
filtration. Monitor the fish for signs of stress or disease and address any issues promptly. Regular observation will
help ensure they are thriving and healthy.

## Compatibility

Kyathit Danios are peaceful and social fish that get along well with other small, non-aggressive species. They are
well-suited for community tanks with other calm fish like tetras, small barbs, and peaceful bottom dwellers. Avoid
keeping them with larger or more aggressive fish that might intimidate or harm them. Providing a well-structured tank
with ample swimming space will help create a harmonious environment.

## Breeding

Breeding Kyathit Danios in captivity is achievable with proper conditions. They are egg scatterers and typically spawn
on fine-leaved plants or spawning mops. To encourage breeding, maintain a slightly higher water temperature around
24-26°C and provide a well-planted tank with hiding spots. After spawning, monitor the eggs closely. The fry will need
to be fed with infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming.
