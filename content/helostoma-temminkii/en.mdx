## Overview

The Kissing Gourami (_Helostoma temminkii_), from the family Helostomatidae, is native to Southeast Asia. Known for its
iconic 'kissing' behavior, where individuals press their mouths together, this fish is a popular choice among aquarists.
They can grow quite large, reaching up to 30 cm in ideal conditions, and require ample space in the aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

Kissing Gouramis require a tank size of at least 200 liters due to their potential size. They prefer water temperatures
between 22-28°C, a pH range of 6.0-8.0, and a moderate to high hardness level (GH 5-20). A well-planted tank with open
swimming areas and stable water parameters will help them thrive.

## Feeding and Diet

These fish are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods, including algae, plant material, and small invertebrates. In
captivity, they can be fed a diet of high-quality pellets, flakes, and fresh vegetables like lettuce or spinach.
Occasional live or frozen food, such as brine shrimp or bloodworms, can be given as a treat.

## Care and Maintenance

Kissing Gouramis are hardy but require regular water changes and good filtration. They are known to graze on algae,
which can help with algae control in the aquarium. However, they can become aggressive with their tank mates, especially
if kept in small groups or in a confined space.

## Compatibility

Though generally peaceful, Kissing Gouramis can be territorial, especially with other large fish. They should be kept
with similarly sized, semi-aggressive fish or in a species-only tank. Ideal tank mates include other large, peaceful
fish like certain cichlids or larger barbs.

## Breeding

Breeding Kissing Gouramis in captivity is challenging, as they require specific water conditions and large tanks for
successful spawning. They are egg layers and scatter their eggs among plants. After spawning, it’s best to separate the
adults to prevent them from eating the eggs.
