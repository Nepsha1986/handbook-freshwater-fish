## Overview

Berdmore's Loach (_Syncrossus berdmorei_), also known as the Burmese Tiger Loach, is a strikingly patterned,
semi-aggressive loach from the rivers of Southeast Asia. Its tiger-like stripes make it a popular choice for experienced
aquarists who can meet its specific care requirements. This loach is active and territorial, so a spacious tank and
careful selection of tank mates are necessary.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 200 liters is recommended for Berdmore's Loach, with water temperatures between 24-28Â°C, pH levels of
6.5-7.5, and GH of 5-15. This species enjoys a well-aerated environment with a soft substrate and plenty of hiding
spots, such as rocks, driftwood, and caves. They appreciate a gentle current to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Berdmore's Loach feeds on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they will accept sinking
pellets, frozen or live foods like bloodworms and brine shrimp, and occasional vegetable treats. A varied diet is
essential to maintain their vibrant colors and ensure good health.

## Care and Maintenance

Berdmore's Loach requires stable water conditions and frequent water changes (20-30% weekly). They are sensitive to poor
water quality, so maintaining clean, well-filtered water is crucial. Monitor the tank
