## Overview

**Tetraodon biocellatus**, commonly known as the Figure Eight Puffer, is a distinctive freshwater pufferfish from the
family Tetraodontidae. It gets its name from the figure-eight pattern seen on its back, making it a visually striking
species.

These puffers are small, typically growing to 6-8 cm, and have a lifespan of 5-10 years in captivity. Although they are
small in size, they are known for their aggression and need careful management in a home aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

Tetraodon biocellatus thrives in water temperatures between 24-28°C, with a pH range of 7.0-8.0 and general hardness
between 8-12 GH. Due to their active and somewhat aggressive nature, a tank size of at least 100 liters is recommended,
with brackish water conditions preferred.

They need an environment with plenty of hiding spots, such as caves, driftwood, and plants, but care should be taken
with plants, as puffers may nibble on them.

## Feeding and Diet

**Tetraodon biocellatus** are carnivores, primarily eating invertebrates in the wild. In captivity, their diet should
include hard-shelled foods like snails, shrimp, and crabs to help wear down their constantly growing teeth. You can also
offer live or frozen foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp.

A varied diet is important to ensure proper nutrition and dental health.

## Care and Maintenance

Pufferfish like **Tetraodon biocellatus** require specific care due to their delicate nature and sharp teeth. It’s
important to maintain pristine water conditions with regular water changes and monitoring of water parameters. They are
sensitive to poor water quality, which can quickly lead to health issues.

Keep in mind their teeth will continue growing throughout their life, so providing foods that help file down their teeth
is essential.

## Compatibility

Due to their aggressive nature, **Tetraodon biocellatus** is best kept in a species-only tank or with very fast-moving
fish that can avoid confrontation. They can be territorial, and care should be taken when introducing tank mates. Avoid
keeping them with slow or long-finned fish, as they may nip at fins or attack smaller tankmates.

## Breeding

Breeding **Tetraodon biocellatus** in captivity is very rare. In the wild, they lay eggs in hidden areas, with the male
guarding the eggs until they hatch. Replicating these conditions in a home aquarium is challenging, and successful
breeding is uncommon without specialized setups.
