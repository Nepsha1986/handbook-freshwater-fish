## Overview

The Featherfin Squeaker (Synodontis eupterus) is a distinctive and hardy catfish species belonging to the Mochokidae
family. Native to the rivers and lakes of Central and West Africa, this fish is easily recognized by its large,
feather-like dorsal fin, which gives it its common name. The Featherfin Squeaker is a nocturnal species, preferring to
stay hidden during the day and becoming active at night. It typically grows to a length of 15-20 cm and can live for
8-12 years in a well-maintained aquarium. Known for its peaceful nature, this catfish is a great addition to community
tanks with other larger, non-aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

The Featherfin Squeaker requires a spacious tank of at least 150 liters to accommodate its size and active nighttime
behavior. The water temperature should be maintained between 23-28°C, with a pH level of 6.5 to 7.5, and a water
hardness (GH) of 4-15. A well-aerated tank with a moderate to strong current is ideal, as it mimics the natural riverine
environment of this species. The tank should include plenty of hiding spots, such as caves, driftwood, and dense
vegetation, to provide shelter during the day. Soft, sandy substrate is recommended to prevent injury to their sensitive
barbels.

## Feeding and Diet

Featherfin Squeakers are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods in the wild, including insects, crustaceans, plant
matter, and detritus. In the aquarium, they should be offered a balanced diet consisting of high-quality sinking
pellets, along with live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. They will also scavenge for
uneaten food on the tank bottom, helping to keep the tank clean. It's important to feed them after the lights go out to
align with their nocturnal feeding habits.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Featherfin Squeaker involves regular tank maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-25% and
monitoring water parameters to ensure they remain stable. Due to their nocturnal nature, it’s essential to provide
plenty of hiding spots to reduce stress. Featherfin Squeakers are generally hardy, but good water quality and a varied
diet are key to preventing common health issues, such as bacterial infections and parasitic infestations.

## Compatibility

The Featherfin Squeaker is a peaceful and generally non-aggressive species, making it suitable for community tanks with
other larger, peaceful fish. They should not be kept with small or delicate species, as they may inadvertently harm them
while scavenging. Suitable tank mates include larger tetras, cichlids, and other catfish. Due to their nocturnal habits,
they may not interact much with other fish during the day.

## Breeding

Breeding Featherfin Squeakers in captivity is challenging and rarely occurs without intervention. They are egg
scatterers, and successful breeding typically requires specific conditions, such as a separate breeding tank with soft,
acidic water and fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for the eggs to adhere to. The parents should be removed after
spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs hatch in about 3-4 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or
finely crushed flake food until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
