## Overview

**Puntius mahecola**, commonly known as the Mahecola Barb, is a peaceful species from the Cyprinidae family. Native to
India and Sri Lanka, this medium-sized barb is an excellent choice for community aquariums. Their silver bodies with
faint vertical bands and red-tinged fins make them a visually attractive addition to any aquarium setup.

## Tank Requirements

Mahecola Barbs require an aquarium of at least 75 liters (20 gallons) due to their active nature and schooling behavior.
The ideal water temperature should be between 22-28°C (72-82°F), with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH)
of 5-18. They thrive in well-planted tanks with open swimming spaces and some shaded areas provided by floating plants.
Soft to moderately hard water is preferable.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, **Puntius mahecola** feed on small invertebrates, plant matter, and organic detritus. In
captivity, they will accept a wide range of foods including high-quality flake food, small pellets, and live or frozen
options like brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Occasional feedings of vegetable matter, such as blanched spinach or
zucchini, will benefit their health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

These barbs are relatively easy to care for and are a good option for both novice and experienced aquarists. They prefer
to be kept in groups of at least six individuals, as they are schooling fish and can become stressed if kept alone or in
pairs. Regular water changes of around 20-30% weekly will help keep the water parameters stable and the fish healthy.

## Compatibility

Mahecola Barbs are peaceful and make excellent tankmates for other small, non-aggressive fish like tetras, rasboras, and
Corydoras. Avoid housing them with overly aggressive species or larger fish that may view them as prey. As schooling
fish, they are best kept in groups, which will also help them display their most natural behaviors and vibrant colors.

## Breeding

Breeding **Puntius mahecola** in home aquariums is possible but requires specific conditions. They are egg scatterers
and will typically spawn in a well-planted tank with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop. After spawning, it is best to
remove the adult fish to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch within 24-48 hours, and the fry can be
fed with infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to consume finely crushed flake food.
