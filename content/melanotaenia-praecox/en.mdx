## Overview

Melanotaenia praecox, commonly known as the Dwarf Neon Rainbowfish, is a popular freshwater fish among aquarists due to
its vibrant blue coloration and active swimming behavior. This species is native to streams and rivers in New Guinea and
is well-suited for community aquariums due to its peaceful nature and compatibility with a variety of tank mates.

## Tank Requirements

The Dwarf Neon Rainbowfish thrives in a well-planted aquarium with a minimum size of 80 liters. The water temperature
should be maintained between 24-28°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and general hardness (GH) of 8-12 dGH. Providing a mix
of open swimming areas and dense plant cover will replicate their natural habitat and reduce stress. Regular water
changes and good filtration are essential to maintain high water quality, as these fish are sensitive to poor water
conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

Melanotaenia praecox is an omnivore and has a varied diet in the wild, consisting of small insects, crustaceans, and
plant matter. In the aquarium, they should be fed a balanced diet of high-quality flake food, small pellets, and live or
frozen foods such as daphnia, brine shrimp, and bloodworms. Occasional feeding of vegetable matter like blanched spinach
or spirulina flakes can enhance their color and health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Dwarf Neon Rainbowfish is relatively straightforward, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. It’s
important to maintain stable water conditions, as they are sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and pH. Weekly water
changes of 20-30% are recommended to keep nitrate levels low. Providing a varied diet and a stress-free environment with
plenty of hiding places will ensure they remain healthy and display their best colors.

## Compatibility

Dwarf Neon Rainbowfish are peaceful and can be kept with other non-aggressive species of similar size. Good tank mates
include other small rainbowfish, tetras, rasboras, and peaceful bottom dwellers like Corydoras catfish. Avoid housing
them with larger, aggressive fish that might view them as prey. Keeping them in groups of at least six will encourage
natural schooling behavior and reduce stress.

## Breeding

Breeding Melanotaenia praecox in captivity is possible with the right conditions. To encourage spawning, set up a
separate breeding tank with slightly warmer water (26-28°C) and fine-leaved plants or spawning mops where the females
can lay eggs. The males will display brighter colors and court the females. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent
them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 7-10 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food
until they are large enough to accept newly hatched brine shrimp or crushed flake food.
