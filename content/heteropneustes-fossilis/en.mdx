## Overview

Heteropneustes fossilis, commonly referred to as the Stinging Catfish, is a fascinating species native to South and
Southeast Asia. This fish is well-known for its ability to deliver a painful sting from venomous spines located on its
pectoral fins. It has a slender, eel-like body, typically reaching 25-30 cm in length. The species is hardy and can
tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, which makes it a popular choice for aquarists who are up for the
challenge. Heteropneustes fossilis is predominantly nocturnal, hiding during the day and becoming more active at night.

## Tank Requirements

The Stinging Catfish requires a tank of at least 150 liters to accommodate its size and active nature. The water
temperature should be maintained between 20-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and a water hardness of 5-15 dGH. A sandy
or fine gravel substrate is ideal, along with plenty of hiding spots created by driftwood, rocks, and aquatic plants.
Due to the catfish's nocturnal habits, dim lighting is recommended. A tightly fitting lid is necessary, as these fish
are known to be excellent jumpers. A good filtration system is also essential to maintain water quality, as this species
produces a significant amount of waste.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Heteropneustes fossilis feeds on a variety of foods, including small fish, insects, and plant matter. In an
aquarium setting, they should be offered a varied diet consisting of live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine
shrimp, and small fish. High-quality sinking pellets can also be used as a staple. Feed them in the evening or just
before lights out, as they are more active during these times.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Stinging Catfish requires regular water changes, with 20-30% of the water being replaced weekly to
maintain optimal conditions. Keep an eye on water parameters, as fluctuations can stress the fish and lead to health
issues. Handling this species should be done with extreme caution due to its venomous spines, which can cause a painful
sting. They are generally hardy and resistant to disease if kept in proper conditions, but they should be monitored for
signs of stress or illness.

## Compatibility

Heteropneustes fossilis is relatively peaceful but should be kept with caution due to its venomous spines. They can
coexist with similarly sized, non-aggressive species that inhabit different levels of the tank. Avoid keeping them with
small fish that can be seen as prey or overly aggressive species that may provoke them. It’s best to house them with
species that are active during the day, reducing the chances of conflict.

## Breeding

Breeding Heteropneustes fossilis in captivity is challenging and rarely achieved. In the wild, they breed during the
monsoon season, which is difficult to replicate in a home aquarium. If breeding is attempted, a large tank with soft,
slightly acidic water is required. The female will lay eggs in a hidden area, and the male will guard them until they
hatch. Raising the fry can be difficult, as they require tiny live foods and very clean water.
