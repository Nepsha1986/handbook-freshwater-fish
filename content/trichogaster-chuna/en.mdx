## Overview

**Trichogaster chuna**, commonly known as the Honey Gourami, is a small freshwater fish native to the rivers and streams
of Southeast Asia. This species typically reaches a size of 5-7 cm and has a lifespan of 4 to 6 years.

Honey Gouramis are known for their striking coloration, with males exhibiting a bright orange to golden hue, especially
during breeding season. Their peaceful demeanor makes them ideal for community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

**Trichogaster chuna** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general hardness
(GH) between 5-20 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-28Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 80 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with plenty of hiding spots and open swimming space is essential for these fish. They enjoy
areas with floating plants and gentle water flow.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Trichogaster chuna** are omnivorous and feed on small invertebrates, insects, and plant matter. In
captivity, they readily accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp and
bloodworms.

To maintain their health, it's important to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and plant-based foods.
Feeding should occur once or twice daily, ensuring they consume their meals within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Honey Gouramis are relatively easy to care for, but maintaining good water quality is crucial. Regular water changes of
20-30% each week are recommended to keep the environment clean. A reliable filtration system helps keep the water
well-oxygenated.

Since they are peaceful and social fish, they do well in community tanks. They can be kept with other small,
non-aggressive species.

## Compatibility

**Trichogaster chuna** are best kept with other peaceful fish that share similar water parameters. Suitable tankmates
include tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid keeping them with aggressive or larger fish, as they may become
stressed or intimidated.

Providing adequate hiding spots and a well-planted environment will help these fish feel secure and reduce stress in the
aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding **Trichogaster chuna** in captivity is relatively straightforward. A separate breeding tank with suitable
spawning sites, such as fine-leaved plants, is recommended.

During spawning, the male will create a bubble nest at the surface, and the female will lay eggs inside it. After
spawning, it is best to separate the male from the female to prevent him from becoming aggressive. The fry should be fed
infusoria or finely crushed flakes once they are free-swimming.
