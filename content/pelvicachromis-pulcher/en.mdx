## Overview

_Pelvicachromis pulcher_, commonly known as the Kribensis or Rainbow Cichlid, is a vibrant and attractive fish native to
the rivers and streams of West Africa. This species is popular among aquarium enthusiasts for its striking coloration,
which includes bright reds, blues, and yellows, as well as its engaging and territorial behavior. Kribensis are known
for their distinct appearance, including a noticeable red belly and a contrasting dark stripe running along their body.

## Tank Requirements

Kribensis require a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. They thrive in a temperature range of
24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand, and include plenty of
hiding spots and plant cover, as they are territorial and appreciate having places to retreat and establish territories.
A good filtration system is essential to maintain water quality, with regular water changes of 20-30% weekly.

## Feeding and Diet

_Pelvicachromis pulcher_ is an omnivorous species with a diet that should include high-quality cichlid pellets, flakes,
and occasional live or frozen foods such as worms, brine shrimp, and small invertebrates. In the wild, they feed on a
variety of small aquatic organisms. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance their coloration.
Feed them 2-3 times a day, with portions appropriate to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Kribensis involves maintaining clean and stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. Perform
regular water changes and monitor the fish for common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Their territorial nature
means they may exhibit aggressive behavior towards other fish, particularly during breeding or if their space is
encroached upon. Providing adequate hiding spots and territory can help reduce stress and aggression.

## Compatibility

_Pelvicachromis pulcher_ can be kept with other peaceful species that can tolerate their territorial behavior. Suitable
tank mates include other small to medium-sized, non-aggressive fish. Avoid housing them with larger or overly aggressive
species, as this may lead to stress and conflict. Their territorial nature can also lead to aggression during breeding
or when establishing their territories.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pelvicachromis pulcher_ in captivity is relatively straightforward. They are cave-spawning cichlids, and the
female will lay eggs in a cave or sheltered area within the tank. To encourage breeding, maintain a temperature around
26-28°C and provide a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots. The female will guard the eggs and the resulting
fry, which can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming. The male may help protect the
territory and the fry. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy offspring.
