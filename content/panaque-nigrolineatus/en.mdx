## Overview

The Royal panaque, scientifically known as Panaque nigrolineatus, is a member of the Loricariidae family. Commonly
referred to as the Royal Pleco, this fish is admired for its distinct appearance, featuring bold black and white stripes
and a robust, armored body. Native to the rivers and tributaries of the Amazon Basin in South America, the Royal panaque
is known for its unique ability to digest wood, which constitutes a significant part of its diet.

## Tank Requirements

To keep a Royal panaque healthy and happy, a large aquarium is essential, with a minimum volume of 200 liters. The ideal
water temperature for this species ranges from 24-28Â°C, with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5, and water hardness (GH) of
2-15. The tank should be equipped with a powerful filter to manage the significant amount of waste these fish produce.
Additionally, a heater is necessary to maintain a stable water temperature. Substrate should consist of sand or fine
gravel, and the tank should be decorated with plenty of driftwood, as the Royal panaque will graze on it.

## Feeding and Diet

The Royal panaque's diet in the wild mainly consists of wood, algae, and plant matter. In an aquarium setting, their
diet should be supplemented with fresh vegetables such as zucchini, cucumber, and spinach, along with specialized
sinking pellets and wafers designed for wood-eating fish. It's crucial to include driftwood in the tank, as it is a
primary food source and aids in their digestion. Feeding should be done at night when the fish are most active.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for a Royal panaque requires regular tank maintenance to ensure water quality. Weekly water changes of 20-30% are
recommended to keep the water clean and free of toxins. Regularly check the filter and clean it as needed to handle the
waste load. Monitor the fish for any signs of health issues, such as loss of appetite or abnormal behavior. Common
health problems include fungal and bacterial infections, which can be treated with appropriate medications.

## Compatibility

Royal panaques are generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially with other bottom-dwelling species. They are
best kept with similarly sized, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tank mates include larger tetras, peaceful cichlids, and
other Loricariidae species. Avoid keeping them with aggressive or highly territorial fish, as this can lead to stress
and conflict.

## Breeding

Breeding Royal panaques in captivity is challenging and rarely occurs. To encourage breeding, provide a spacious tank
with ample hiding spots and excellent water quality. Signs of breeding behavior include the male guarding a cave or
crevice where the female will lay her eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the male continues to guard the fry until they are
free-swimming. Raising the fry can be difficult due to their specific dietary needs and the high level of care required.
