## Overview

**Nomorhamphus liemi**, commonly known as Liem's Halfbeak, is a small livebearing fish from the family Zenarchopteridae.
This species is native to the streams and rivers of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Liem's Halfbeak is distinguished by its
elongated lower jaw, resembling a beak, and a streamlined body with a silver-grey coloration. These fish are surface
dwellers, known for their lively behavior and quick movements, making them a fascinating addition to a community
aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

Liem's Halfbeak thrives in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 60 liters (about 16 gallons). The ideal
water temperature ranges from 22-28°C (72-82°F), with a pH level between 7.0-8.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 10-20.
The tank should be well-planted with floating plants to provide cover and reduce light intensity, mimicking their
natural habitat. An aquarium with gentle water flow and a secure lid is recommended to prevent these active fish from
jumping out.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, **Nomorhamphus liemi** primarily feeds on small insects and invertebrates found near the water
surface. In captivity, they should be provided with a varied diet, including high-quality flakes or pellets designed for
surface feeders, along with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and mosquito larvae. Feeding them small
amounts multiple times a day can help replicate their natural feeding habits and keep them active and healthy.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Liem's Halfbeak requires regular tank maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-30% to maintain high
water quality and stable parameters. A good filtration system is essential to keep the water clean and oxygenated, as
these fish are sensitive to poor water conditions. Monitoring the water parameters regularly and ensuring a stress-free
environment will help prevent diseases and promote a long lifespan.

## Compatibility

Liem's Halfbeak is generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish species. Ideal tank mates
include small tetras, rasboras, and other livebearers that share similar water parameter requirements. Avoid keeping
them with larger, aggressive fish that may see them as prey or outcompete them for food. It's best to keep them in small
groups of their own species to reduce stress and encourage natural behaviors.

## Breeding

Breeding **Nomorhamphus liemi** in captivity can be moderately challenging but rewarding. As a livebearing species,
females give birth to fully developed fry rather than laying eggs. To encourage breeding, provide a well-planted
aquarium with plenty of hiding spaces and a diet rich in live foods. Females can be identified by their larger size and
more rounded bellies. Once the fry are born, they should be separated from the adults to prevent predation and fed with
infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to consume larger foods.
