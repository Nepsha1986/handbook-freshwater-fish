## Overview

Cichlasoma nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaragua Cichlid, is a striking species native to the freshwater lakes
and rivers of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The fish is well known for its vibrant coloration, displaying a mix of blue,
green, yellow, and red hues. These cichlids are relatively peaceful compared to other members of their family, making
them suitable for a community tank with similarly sized species. They can grow up to 25 cm in length, making them a
prominent feature in any aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

The Nicaragua Cichlid requires a spacious tank of at least 200 liters, given its size and active nature. The water
temperature should be maintained between 24-28Â°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness of 6-15 dGH. A sandy or
fine gravel substrate is ideal, along with rocks, driftwood, and plenty of hiding spots created by aquatic plants. The
tank should have a strong filtration system to maintain water quality, as these fish are sensitive to poor conditions.
Moderate lighting is recommended to bring out their vibrant colors.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Cichlasoma nicaraguense primarily feeds on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In captivity, they
should be offered a varied diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, frozen or live foods like brine shrimp and
bloodworms, as well as some vegetable matter like spinach or spirulina-based flakes. Feeding them twice a day is usually
sufficient, ensuring that all food is consumed within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Nicaragua Cichlids involves regular water changes, with 20-30% of the water being replaced weekly to maintain
optimal conditions. It's important to monitor water parameters closely, as these fish are sensitive to fluctuations.
They are generally hardy but should be watched for common cichlid health issues, such as infections or parasites.
Maintaining a stable environment with good water quality is key to preventing stress and disease.

## Compatibility

Cichlasoma nicaraguense is relatively peaceful for a cichlid but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They
can be kept with other similarly sized, non-aggressive cichlids, as well as robust community fish. Avoid housing them
with small, delicate species that may be harassed. They do well in pairs or small groups, but ensure that the tank is
large enough to prevent territorial disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding Cichlasoma nicaraguense is relatively straightforward in a well-maintained tank. They are substrate spawners,
laying their eggs on a flat surface such as a rock or piece of driftwood. The female will guard the eggs while the male
defends the territory. The eggs typically hatch within 3-4 days, and the fry become free-swimming after another 5-7
days. Feeding the fry with finely crushed flakes or specialized fry food is recommended for healthy growth.
