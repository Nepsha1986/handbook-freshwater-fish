## Overview

Hemigrammus erythrozonus, commonly known as the Red Line Tetra, is a vibrant freshwater fish native to the Amazon Basin
in South America. This species is renowned for the striking red line that runs along its body, contrasting with its
silver base color. Typically reaching 4-5 cm in length, the Red Line Tetra is a peaceful, schooling fish that thrives in
community aquariums. With a lifespan of 5-7 years, it adds a splash of color and liveliness to any tank setup.

## Tank Requirements

The Red Line Tetra requires a well-planted aquarium with ample swimming space. A minimum tank size of 60 liters is
recommended, with water temperatures between 22-28°C, a pH range of 6.0-7.5, and general hardness (GH) of 4-15. They
prefer subdued lighting and dark substrates to highlight their vibrant colors. A gentle water flow is ideal, and the
tank should be decorated with plenty of plants and hiding spots to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Hemigrammus erythrozonus feeds on small invertebrates and plant material. In captivity, they
should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality flake food, micro-pellets, and occasional live or
frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Feeding small amounts multiple times a day helps to maintain
their health and coloration. A balanced diet is essential for their overall well-being and longevity.

## Care and Maintenance

Hemigrammus erythrozonus is relatively easy to care for, making it a suitable choice for beginners. Regular water
changes of 20-25% weekly are important to maintain water quality. Since these fish are sensitive to poor water
conditions, it’s crucial to monitor temperature, pH, and hardness regularly. Keeping the tank clean and ensuring proper
filtration will help prevent common diseases. Regular health checks and maintaining stable conditions will contribute to
their long-term health.

## Compatibility

The Red Line Tetra is a peaceful species that fits well into community tanks. They should be kept in schools of at least
six individuals to feel secure. Suitable tank mates include other small, non-aggressive fish such as rasboras, small
tetras, Corydoras catfish, and dwarf gouramis. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive species that may see them as
prey. Their peaceful nature and compatibility with various species make them an excellent choice for a harmonious
aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding Hemigrammus erythrozonus in captivity requires some effort but is achievable with the right setup. A separate
breeding tank with slightly acidic water (pH 6.0-6.5) and a temperature of 26-28°C is recommended. Provide a dimly lit
environment with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop for the female to scatter eggs. Conditioning the breeding pair
with live foods will increase the chances of successful spawning. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from
eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or newly hatched brine
shrimp until they grow large enough to accept larger foods.
