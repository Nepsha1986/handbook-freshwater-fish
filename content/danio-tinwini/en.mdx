## Overview

Danio tinwini, commonly referred to as Tinwini Danio, is a small and peaceful freshwater species native to Myanmar. Its
distinctive spotted pattern and small size make it an excellent choice for nano tanks and well-maintained community
aquariums. These fish are active swimmers and do well in groups.

## Tank Requirements

Danio tinwini thrives in tanks of at least 40 liters. The optimal water temperature ranges from 22-26Â°C, with a pH of
6.0-7.5 and a general hardness of 5-15 dGH. A well-planted tank with soft substrate and gentle water movement will help
replicate their natural habitat. Providing ample open swimming space is essential for their active nature.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Danio tinwini feeds on small insects and plankton. In an aquarium setting, they are omnivorous and will
readily accept high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and live or frozen foods such as daphnia and brine shrimp. A
varied diet helps maintain their health and vibrant appearance.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio tinwini is relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water changes and
tank maintenance are important to keep water quality high. As they are small, pay attention to water parameters and
avoid drastic fluctuations that could stress the fish.

## Compatibility

Tinwini Danios are peaceful fish that do well in community aquariums with other small, non-aggressive species. Ideal
tank mates include small tetras, rasboras, and shrimp. Keep them in schools of at least 6 individuals to reduce stress
and encourage natural shoaling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio tinwini in captivity is achievable under the right conditions. They are egg scatterers, and providing a
separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants will improve breeding success. After spawning, remove the adults to
protect the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or liquid fry food.
