## Overview

Abramites hypselonotus, commonly known as the Marbled Headstander or High-backed Headstander, is a fascinating
freshwater fish native to South America. This species is characterized by its high-backed, elongated body and unique
head-down swimming posture. Growing to a size of 12-15 cm, the Marbled Headstander is an active and sometimes aggressive
fish that requires a large, well-maintained aquarium. It is best suited for experienced aquarists due to its specific
care needs and temperament.

## Tank Requirements

The Marbled Headstander requires a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 200 liters to accommodate its active nature
and territorial behavior. The water temperature should be maintained between 22-28Â°C, with a pH level ranging from 6.0
to 7.5 and general hardness (GH) of 5-15. The tank should be heavily planted with robust plants, as this species may
damage delicate ones. Additionally, provide plenty of hiding spots with rocks, driftwood, and other decorations to help
reduce aggression. A strong filter is essential to maintain high water quality, and regular water changes are necessary.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Abramites hypselonotus primarily feeds on plant matter, algae, and detritus. In captivity, it should be
provided with a diet rich in vegetable matter, such as spirulina-based foods, blanched vegetables (e.g., spinach,
zucchini), and algae wafers. Supplement their diet with occasional live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp,
and insect larvae to provide a balanced diet. Feeding should be done once or twice daily, and care should be taken to
remove any uneaten food to maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Abramites hypselonotus involves maintaining stable water conditions and monitoring its behavior. Regular
water changes of 20-25% weekly are necessary to ensure optimal water quality. Due to its aggressive and territorial
nature, it's important to keep an eye on interactions with tank mates and provide adequate hiding spots to prevent
stress and injuries. A well-covered tank is recommended to prevent this active fish from jumping out. Watch for signs of
stress or illness, and address any issues promptly.

## Compatibility

The Marbled Headstander is known for its aggressive and territorial behavior, especially towards fish with similar body
shapes or those that occupy the same tank level. It is best kept with other robust species that can stand their ground,
such as larger cichlids, catfish, or other headstanders. Avoid housing them with small, delicate, or slow-moving fish,
as they may be harassed or outcompeted for food. It's recommended to keep this species singly or in a carefully planned
community tank with similarly sized and temperament-matched tank mates.

## Breeding

Breeding Abramites hypselonotus in captivity is extremely challenging and rarely successful. This species is known to
spawn in fast-flowing waters with specific environmental conditions that are difficult to replicate in a home aquarium.
If breeding is attempted, it is essential to provide a large tank with strong water currents, plenty of oxygenation, and
a spawning area with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop. The eggs are usually scattered and require careful protection
from other fish. Due to the difficulty in breeding this species, it is not commonly bred in captivity, and most
available specimens are wild-caught.
