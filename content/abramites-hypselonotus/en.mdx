## Overview

The Marbled Headstander (_Abramites hypselonotus_) is an unusual freshwater fish from the Characidae family. It inhabits
rivers in South America, primarily in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. It is distinguished by its high, laterally
compressed body and marbled pattern on its scales, making it attractive to aquarists. This fish is active and
territorial, requiring a spacious aquarium and careful selection of tank mates. Unlike most related species, it actively
feeds on algae and soft plant leaves.

The Marbled Headstander has several features that make it an unusual aquarium inhabitant:

It is less common than other characins, so keeping it is considered a "highlight" for experienced aquarists.

### How to Distinguish Male from Female Marbled Headstanders?

Sexual dimorphism is weakly expressed, but there are several distinctive features:

- **Size**: Females are usually larger and more robust than males, especially during spawning.
- **Body Shape**: Males have a slimmer and more elongated body, while females appear rounder.
- **Behavior**: Males are more active and may exhibit territoriality, especially during the breeding season.

## Aquarium Requirements

Marbled Headstanders require an aquarium of at least **200 liters** with plenty of swimming space. Optimal water
parameters are:

- **Temperature**: 22-28Â°C
- **pH**: 6.0-7.5
- **Hardness (dGH)**: 5-15

The aquarium should be decorated with driftwood, large rocks, and dense vegetation. Strong water flow and high-quality
filtration are necessary, as the fish is sensitive to water pollution.

## Feeding and Diet

The Marbled Headstander is omnivorous but prefers plant-based foods. The diet should consist of:

- Algae and vegetables (cucumbers, zucchini, spinach)
- Granules and flakes with plant components
- Live and frozen food (brine shrimp, daphnia, bloodworms)

It is important to limit the amount of protein-rich food to avoid digestive issues.

## Care and Maintenance

This fish requires regular care, including weekly water changes (_20-30%_) and substrate cleaning. A powerful external
filter and an air pump for aeration are recommended. Lighting should be moderate, as too bright light can cause stress.

## Compatibility

Marbled Headstanders are quite active and can be aggressive towards small or slow-moving species. Good tank mates
include:

- Large characins (_Congo tetras, Metynnis_)
- Medium-sized cichlids
- Catfish (_Plecos, Ancistrus_)

It is not recommended to keep them with small fish, shrimp, or species with long fins.

The Marbled Headstander may eat plants, especially soft and delicate species. To preserve aquarium vegetation, choose
more robust plants that are less easily damaged.

To protect plants, you can also add various types of tougher algae or aquarium "cover" plants that serve as shelters and
help plants recover more quickly after being eaten.

If the Marbled Headstander still eats plants, it is important to provide a varied diet to reduce the need for consuming
aquarium vegetation.

## Breeding

Breeding Marbled Headstanders in home aquariums is challenging and rarely successful. In the wild, they spawn during the
rainy season, which is difficult to replicate in an aquarium. Sexual dimorphism is weakly expressed, with females
usually larger than males. Under favorable conditions, the fish may spawn, but the survival rate of fry in captivity is
low due to their sensitivity to water parameters.
