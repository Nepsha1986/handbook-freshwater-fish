## Overview

The Daffodil Cichlid (_Neolamprologus pulcher_) is a fascinating species from Lake Tanganyika in Africa. Known for its
elongated body, soft yellow coloration, and daffodil-like blue highlights, this cichlid stands out among other
freshwater fish. Its natural habitat includes rocky shorelines where it finds shelter in crevices, making it an
interesting and visually appealing choice for aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

To keep Daffodil Cichlids healthy, provide a tank of at least 100 liters with a temperature range of 24-26Â°C. The water
should have a pH of 7.8-9.0 and moderate to high hardness (GH 10-20). Since they enjoy rocky environments, setting up an
aquarium with stones and caves will mimic their natural habitat. A sandy substrate is also recommended to prevent
injuries.

## Feeding and Diet

Daffodil Cichlids are omnivorous and enjoy a mix of foods, including high-quality pellets, flake food, and occasional
live or frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms. A varied diet is essential to keep them vibrant and healthy. Feed
them small portions two to three times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular maintenance is necessary to keep Daffodil Cichlids healthy. Perform weekly water changes of 20-25% and maintain
stable water conditions, as they are sensitive to fluctuations. Ensure the tank environment is clean and free of debris
to reduce the risk of disease.

## Compatibility

Daffodil Cichlids are territorial but generally peaceful, especially when kept with other Lake Tanganyika species. They
can be kept with other small to medium-sized cichlids or peaceful tank mates, as long as they are given plenty of space
and hiding places. They do well in groups but may exhibit mild aggression, particularly during breeding.

## Breeding

Breeding Daffodil Cichlids is relatively straightforward in a well-maintained tank. They are cave spawners, so providing
ample hiding spots will encourage breeding. Once the eggs are laid, both parents protect the fry, which makes them ideal
for family tanks. Fry can be fed infusoria or crushed flake food once they are free-swimming.
