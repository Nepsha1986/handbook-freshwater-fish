## Overview

**Pethia conchonius**, commonly known as the Rosy Barb, is a resilient and brightly colored freshwater fish from the
Cyprinidae family. Native to the rivers and streams of South Asia, these fish are popular for their vibrant coloration,
ease of care, and lively nature.

Rosy Barbs can grow to a size of 10-15 cm and have a lifespan of 5-7 years in well-maintained aquariums. They are a
hardy species that can tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making them a good choice for beginner aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Rosy Barbs thrive in temperatures between 18-25°C, with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and a water hardness of 5-15 GH. They require a
minimum tank size of 75 liters but do better in larger setups due to their active swimming habits.

These fish prefer well-planted tanks with open swimming spaces and some hiding spots, such as driftwood or rock
formations. A moderate current can also be beneficial, as it mimics their natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

**Pethia conchonius** are omnivorous and will readily accept a variety of foods. A balanced diet can consist of
high-quality flakes or pellets, along with frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms.

They also enjoy vegetable matter in their diet, so occasional feedings of blanched vegetables like spinach or zucchini
are recommended.

## Care and Maintenance

Rosy Barbs are easy to care for and adapt well to different water conditions. Regular water changes and a stable
filtration system are essential to keep them healthy. As an active and social species, they should be kept in groups of
at least five to reduce stress and encourage natural behavior.

It’s important to monitor for any signs of aggression, especially among males during breeding periods. However, they are
generally peaceful and do well in community tanks.

## Compatibility

Rosy Barbs are peaceful fish but can occasionally nip the fins of slower-moving tankmates. They are best kept with other
fast-moving species that can keep up with their active nature. Suitable tankmates include tetras, danios, and other
barbs. Avoid keeping them with long-finned species like angelfish or bettas, which may become targets for fin nipping.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pethia conchonius** is relatively easy in a home aquarium. They are egg scatterers and do not exhibit
parental care. To breed them, set up a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop. The water
temperature should be slightly elevated (around 24-26°C) to encourage spawning.

Once eggs are laid, remove the adults, as they may eat the eggs. The eggs will hatch within 24-48 hours, and the fry can
be fed with infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
