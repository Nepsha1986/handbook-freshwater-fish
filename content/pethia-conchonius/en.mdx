## Overview

The Rosy Barb (_Pethia conchonius_) is a popular freshwater fish from the Cyprinidae family, native to the rivers and
streams of South Asia, primarily India and Bangladesh. It was one of the first barb species to enter the aquarium hobby
and remains one of the most sought-after due to its combination of vibrant coloration, hardiness, and ease of care.

Adults reach 10–15 cm in length and live 5–7 years. The body is tall and slightly laterally compressed, with a
characteristic golden-pink sheen. Males develop an intense pinkish-red coloration during breeding, which gave the fish
its common names — rosy, red, or fire barb. Males' fins often feature black edging, giving them a particularly striking
appearance.

_Pethia conchonius_ is a diurnal, active, and schooling species. The fish are constantly on the move, exploring all
levels of the aquarium. Keeping them in groups of at least 6 allows observation of natural social behavior and reduces
their tendency to nip the fins of tank mates.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females?

Sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced:

- **Coloration**: Males are significantly more colorful — ranging from pink to intense red, especially during breeding.
  Females are more modestly colored in golden-olive tones.
- **Body shape**: Females are larger and fuller, with a rounded belly. Males are slimmer and more streamlined.
- **Fins**: Males often have black-edged dorsal and anal fins.

## Tank Requirements

A school of 6–8 Rosy Barbs requires an aquarium of at least **75 liters**. Due to their activity level, the fish need
ample swimming space, so elongated tanks are preferred.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature**: 18–25°C
- **pH**: 6.5–7.5
- **Hardness (dGH)**: 5–15

One of the remarkable features of this species is its tolerance for lower temperatures. Rosy Barbs thrive at 18–20°C,
which allows them to be kept in unheated aquariums in rooms with ambient temperature.

Combine dense planting along the sides and back wall with open swimming space in the center. Any substrate works — from
fine gravel to sand. Driftwood and rocks provide additional shelter. Moderate flow from the filter mimics natural
conditions. A lid is recommended, as the fish may jump when startled.

## Feeding and Diet

_Pethia conchonius_ is an undemanding omnivore that readily accepts virtually any food. The diet should consist of:

- High-quality flakes or granules for tropical fish (daily staple)
- Frozen foods: brine shrimp, daphnia, bloodworms, cyclops
- Live foods: small bloodworms, daphnia, tubifex — excellent supplementary feeding, especially before breeding
- Vegetable supplements: blanched spinach, zucchini, spirulina tablets

Feed twice daily in small portions. Rosy Barbs are prone to overeating, so it is important to offer only as much food as
the fish consume within 2–3 minutes. A varied diet maintains vivid coloration, especially in males.

## Care and Maintenance

The Rosy Barb is one of the easiest aquarium species to keep, ideal for beginners. Key recommendations:

- **Water changes**: 20–25% weekly
- **Filtration**: a standard internal or external filter with moderate flow
- **Aeration**: recommended, though the fish are not overly demanding regarding oxygen levels
- **Lighting**: moderate; under bright light, male coloration displays most impressively

The species is extremely hardy and adapts easily to various conditions. Nevertheless, stable water parameters are the
key to health and longevity. Regularly test ammonia and nitrite levels, especially during the first months after setting
up the aquarium. Vacuum the substrate during water changes to remove food remnants and organic waste.

## Compatibility

_Pethia conchonius_ is a peaceful and sociable species, well-suited for community tanks. However, like many barbs, they
may nip the long fins of slow-moving tank mates. Keeping them in groups of 6 or more significantly reduces this
tendency, as the fish focus their attention on intra-school hierarchy.

Good tank mates:

- [Tiger Barb](/en/puntius-tetrazona) and other barbs
- [Black Ruby Barb](/en/pethia-nigrofasciata) — an excellent companion from the same genus
- [Zebra Danio](/en/danio-rerio) and other danios — active and fast
- [Black Skirt Tetra](/en/gymnocorymbus-ternetzi) and other active tetras
- [Corydoras](/en/corydoras-aeneus) — peaceful bottom dwellers

Avoid keeping them with slow, long-finned species: [Bettas](/en/betta-splendens), veil-tail angelfish, and fancy guppies
may suffer from nipping.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pethia conchonius_ is one of the easiest among aquarium fish and is achievable even for beginner aquarists.
This is an egg-scattering species with no parental care.

To set up for spawning:

- A separate breeding tank of at least 30 liters
- Temperature of 24–26°C (slightly above normal)
- Fine-leaved plants or synthetic spawning mop on the bottom as spawning substrate
- A protective mesh over the bottom to prevent egg predation

Intensive live food feeding for a week stimulates breeding readiness. The female deposits up to 200–300 eggs, which fall
into the plants or under the mesh. After spawning, promptly remove the adults — they will actively consume their own
eggs.

Fry hatch within 24–48 hours and become free-swimming after 2–3 days. Initial food should be infusoria and liquid fry
food; after about a week, they can be transitioned to baby brine shrimp. Growth is rapid, and by 2–3 months the
juveniles already display adult coloration.
