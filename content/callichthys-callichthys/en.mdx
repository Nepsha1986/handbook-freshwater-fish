## Overview

**Callichthys callichthys**, commonly known as the Armored Catfish, is a fascinating species belonging to the
Callichthyidae family. This fish is known for its distinctive armor-like plates that cover its body, providing
protection and giving it a unique appearance. Native to South America, particularly in the Amazon and Orinoco river
basins, Callichthys callichthys thrives in slow-moving or stagnant waters, often found in areas with abundant
vegetation.

## Tank Requirements

To keep Callichthys callichthys healthy and thriving, it is essential to provide a tank that mimics its natural habitat.
A tank size of at least 30 gallons is recommended, with water temperatures ranging between 72째F and 79째F (22째C - 26째C)
and a pH level of 6.0 to 8.0. The substrate should be soft, preferably sand, to prevent damage to their delicate
barbels. The tank should include plenty of hiding spots, such as driftwood, caves, and dense vegetation. A filter with
gentle water flow is ideal, as this species prefers calm waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Callichthys callichthys feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, detritus, and plant matter. In an
aquarium setting, they readily accept a diet of sinking pellets, algae wafers, and frozen or live foods such as
bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. It is important to provide a varied diet to ensure they receive all the necessary
nutrients. Feeding should occur once or twice a day, with care taken to avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Callichthys callichthys is a hardy species that can adapt to a wide range of water conditions, making it relatively easy
to care for. Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) are necessary to maintain water quality. Tank cleaning should focus
on removing debris from the substrate, as these catfish are bottom dwellers. Monitoring water parameters is essential to
prevent stress and disease. Common health issues include bacterial infections and fin rot, which can be prevented by
maintaining clean water and providing a balanced diet.

## Compatibility

Callichthys callichthys is a peaceful and social species, making it an excellent addition to community tanks. They do
well with other non-aggressive fish, particularly those that inhabit the upper and middle levels of the tank. Suitable
tank mates include tetras, rasboras, and small cichlids. However, they should not be housed with large or aggressive
fish that may see them as prey. These catfish enjoy the company of their own species, so keeping them in small groups is
recommended.

## Breeding

Breeding Callichthys callichthys in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. They are egg-layers that typically spawn
during the rainy season in the wild. To encourage breeding, simulate the rainy season by lowering the water temperature
slightly and performing frequent water changes with soft, slightly acidic water. The female will lay eggs on the
underside of a broad leaf or other flat surfaces, and the male will fertilize them. After spawning, it is best to remove
the parents to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 3-5 days, and the fry can be fed
infusoria or finely crushed flake food until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
