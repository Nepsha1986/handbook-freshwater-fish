## Overview

The Electric Blue Hap (Sciaenochromis fryeri) belongs to the Cichlidae family and is native to Lake Malawi in East
Africa. This species is renowned for its dazzling electric blue color, especially in males, and can reach a size of
12-15 cm. The Electric Blue Hap is a popular choice among cichlid enthusiasts and is best suited for aquarists with some
experience due to its specific tank requirements and semi-aggressive temperament.

## Tank Requirements

Electric Blue Haps require a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 200 liters. The water temperature should be
maintained between 24-28°C, with a pH level of 7.8-8.6 and a water hardness (GH) of 10-20. These fish prefer a rocky
environment with plenty of caves and hiding spots, which helps mimic their natural habitat in Lake Malawi. A sandy
substrate is recommended, and good water filtration is essential to maintain high water quality. Regular water changes
are crucial to keep the environment stable and healthy for these active swimmers.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Electric Blue Haps are primarily piscivores, feeding on smaller fish and invertebrates. In an aquarium
setting, they should be fed a diet rich in protein, including high-quality cichlid pellets, along with occasional treats
like frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, krill, or small fish. It is important to avoid overfeeding and to
provide a varied diet to maintain their vibrant coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Electric Blue Haps require regular care, including weekly water changes of 25-30% to maintain water quality. They are
sensitive to poor water conditions, so it's essential to monitor water parameters closely. These fish are prone to bloat
if fed an improper diet, so it's important to provide high-quality food and avoid foods that are too rich in fats.
Regular observation for signs of stress or illness, such as changes in behavior or appetite, is crucial for keeping them
healthy.

## Compatibility

Electric Blue Haps are semi-aggressive and territorial, particularly towards other males of the same species. They are
best kept in a species-specific tank or with other similar-sized cichlids from Lake Malawi that can hold their own. It's
important to avoid housing them with smaller, more docile fish, as they may become aggressive. Providing plenty of
hiding spots can help reduce territorial disputes and aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Electric Blue Haps can be challenging but rewarding. They are mouthbrooders, with the female carrying the
fertilized eggs and later the fry in her mouth until they are ready to swim freely. To encourage breeding, maintain a
slightly higher water temperature of around 26-28°C and provide plenty of hiding spots for the female. The male will
establish a territory and display vibrant colors to attract the female. Once the fry are released, they can be fed with
crushed flake food or baby brine shrimp. It's advisable to separate the fry from the adults to prevent predation.
