## Overview

**Aspidoras fuscoguttatus**, also known as the Brown-spotted Aspidoras, is a small, peaceful catfish species from the
family Callichthyidae. Native to the freshwater habitats of Brazil, this species is a delightful addition to community
aquariums due to its gentle nature and bottom-dwelling habits. Aspidoras fuscoguttatus typically reaches a size of 4-5
cm (1.6-2 inches) and has a lifespan of 3-5 years in captivity. They are social fish, often seen in groups, and thrive
in a well-maintained environment with plenty of hiding spots and soft substrates.

## Tank Requirements

Brown-spotted Aspidoras require a tank that mimics their natural habitat, with a minimum volume of 50 liters (13
gallons). The water temperature should be maintained between 22-28째C (72-82째F), with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and general
hardness (GH) of 2-15. A soft, sandy substrate is ideal to prevent damage to their delicate barbels while foraging. The
tank should also include plenty of hiding places, such as driftwood, rocks, and aquatic plants, to provide a sense of
security and reduce stress. Moderate water flow and good filtration are important to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

Aspidoras fuscoguttatus are omnivores and require a varied diet to remain healthy. In their natural habitat, they feed
on small invertebrates, plant matter, and detritus found on the riverbed. In an aquarium setting, they can be fed
high-quality sinking pellets, frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. It's also beneficial
to provide occasional feedings of vegetable matter, such as blanched spinach or zucchini, to mimic their natural diet
and maintain good health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Aspidoras fuscoguttatus is relatively straightforward, making them suitable for beginners. Regular water
changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended to keep the tank environment clean and stable. Maintaining good water quality
is crucial to prevent stress and disease. It's also important to avoid sharp or coarse substrates that can injure their
barbels, which they use to forage for food. Ensure a balanced diet and provide a peaceful environment to keep them
stress-free.

## Compatibility

Brown-spotted Aspidoras are peaceful and do well in a community tank with other small, non-aggressive species. They are
best kept in groups of at least 6 to promote natural schooling behavior and reduce stress. Suitable tank mates include
small tetras, rasboras, dwarf cichlids, and other peaceful bottom dwellers. Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive
fish that may outcompete them for food or harass them.

## Breeding

Breeding Aspidoras fuscoguttatus in captivity can be challenging but is possible with the right conditions. To encourage
spawning, maintain a stable, clean environment with plenty of hiding spots. A slight increase in water temperature to
around 26-28째C (79-82째F) and frequent small water changes can help stimulate breeding behavior. The female lays eggs on
flat surfaces such as leaves or the aquarium glass. Once the eggs are laid, parents do not guard them, so it may be
necessary to remove the eggs to a separate breeding tank to protect them from being eaten by other fish. The eggs hatch
within 3-5 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or commercially available fry food until they are large enough to eat
crushed flakes or micro-worms.
