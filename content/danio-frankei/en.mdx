## Overview

**Danio frankei**, commonly known as the Leopard Danio, is a popular aquarium species due to its small size, peaceful
nature, and attractive spotted pattern. Originating from the freshwater streams of Southeast Asia, these fish are easy
to care for, making them great for beginners.

They grow to a size of 4-6 cm and have a lifespan of about 3-5 years. Their lively and social behavior makes them an
excellent addition to community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

**Danio frankei** are active swimmers, so a tank with a minimum volume of 50 liters is recommended. They prefer water
temperatures between 18-26°C, with a GH of 5-15 and a pH of 6.5-7.5.

It’s important to provide ample swimming space, along with some plants and hiding spots to mimic their natural habitat.
A filter with moderate water flow will help simulate the streams where they are typically found.

## Feeding and Diet

These omnivores will accept a wide variety of foods. High-quality flakes or pellets should form the staple of their
diet, but they will also benefit from supplemental feedings of live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, or
bloodworms.

For balanced nutrition, you can occasionally offer them small vegetable-based foods like blanched spinach or zucchini.

## Care and Maintenance

**Danio frankei** are hardy fish and relatively undemanding when it comes to care. Regular water changes, proper
filtration, and maintaining stable water parameters will keep them healthy and active.

Because they are shoaling fish, it is best to keep them in groups of six or more. This not only reduces stress but also
encourages their natural schooling behavior.

## Compatibility

Leopard Danios are peaceful and can be kept with a variety of other community fish, including tetras, rasboras, and
small catfish species. Avoid pairing them with large or aggressive fish that may bully or outcompete them for food.

They are especially well-suited to aquariums with other similarly-sized species that share their need for slightly
cooler water temperatures.

## Breeding

Breeding **Danio frankei** is fairly straightforward. They are egg scatterers, and the female will lay eggs among plants
or in gravel. To increase the chances of survival, it's best to move the adults to a breeding tank and remove them once
eggs are laid, as they may eat the eggs.

The eggs hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed finely crushed flake food or infusoria until they are large
enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
