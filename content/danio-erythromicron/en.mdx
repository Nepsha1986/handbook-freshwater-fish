## Overview

Danio erythromicron, also known as the Emerald Dwarf Rasbora or Emerald Dwarf Danio, is a small, brightly colored
freshwater fish native to Inle Lake in Myanmar. It is highly sought after by aquarists due to its peaceful nature, small
size (2-3 cm), and vibrant coloration. This species is ideal for nano tanks and community setups with other peaceful
species. The Emerald Dwarf Rasbora is best kept in planted tanks that mimic their natural habitat, providing hiding
spaces and areas for free swimming.

## Tank Requirements

Danio erythromicron thrives in smaller tanks of at least 40 liters. The water temperature should be maintained between
20-24°C, with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-15. They prefer slightly cooler water compared to
tropical species. A well-planted tank with soft lighting and areas of open swimming space is ideal. They also appreciate
the presence of floating plants to diffuse light and provide additional cover. Ensure the tank has a gentle water flow,
as this mimics their natural environment in slow-moving waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Danio erythromicron feeds on small invertebrates and zooplankton. In captivity, they readily accept a
variety of small foods, including micro-pellets, crushed flakes, and live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia,
and microworms. To maintain their vibrant colors and health, a varied diet rich in protein and plant matter is
recommended. Feeding small amounts 2-3 times a day helps avoid overfeeding and maintains water quality in nano tanks.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio erythromicron is a relatively easy species to care for, making it suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water
changes (around 25-30% weekly) are important to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor water parameters closely, as
they are sensitive to drastic changes in temperature or water quality. Additionally, provide sufficient filtration to
maintain oxygen levels and prevent debris buildup, but avoid strong currents as these fish prefer calm waters.

## Compatibility

The Emerald Dwarf Rasbora is a peaceful species that thrives in a community tank with other small, non-aggressive fish.
Suitable tank mates include other danios, small rasboras, tetras, and shrimp species. Avoid housing them with larger or
aggressive species that might see them as prey. Keeping them in small schools of 6-10 individuals enhances their natural
behavior, reduces stress, and brings out their striking colors.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio erythromicron in captivity is possible, though it requires some patience. Provide a separate breeding
tank with soft, acidic water (pH 6.0-7.0) and slightly warmer temperatures around 24-26°C. Spawning typically occurs
among fine-leaved plants or spawning mops. The female will scatter her eggs, which the male will then fertilize. After
spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days, and the fry can be
fed infusoria or liquid fry food before transitioning to baby brine shrimp.
