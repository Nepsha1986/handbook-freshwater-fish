## Overview

The Shell Dweller (_Lamprologus ocellatus_), native to Lake Tanganyika in Africa, is a small, fascinating cichlid known
for its unique habit of living in empty shells. With a compact body and large eyes, this fish has a bold personality and
shows a strong attachment to its chosen shell, making it a favorite among cichlid enthusiasts.

## Tank Requirements

Shell Dwellers thrive in tanks of at least 40 liters, with a temperature range of 24-26Â°C, a pH between 7.8 and 9.0, and
hardness (GH) of 10-20. A sandy substrate is essential for their natural digging behavior, and shells, such as those
from escargot, are a must to allow them to establish territories. Minimal decoration and plenty of open space are ideal
for these active fish.

## Feeding and Diet

Shell Dwellers are omnivores, benefiting from a varied diet of high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods
like brine shrimp and daphnia. Feeding twice a day with small portions keeps them active and healthy.

## Care and Maintenance

Routine tank maintenance is necessary, with weekly water changes of around 20-25% to keep the water quality stable.
Regular monitoring of water parameters is recommended to ensure a healthy environment, as Shell Dwellers are sensitive
to poor water quality.

## Compatibility

These cichlids are best kept in species-specific tanks or with other small, non-aggressive Lake Tanganyika fish. They
exhibit territorial behavior, especially around their shells, and are best kept in pairs or small groups. Avoid keeping
them with larger or aggressive species.

## Breeding

Shell Dwellers readily breed in captivity when provided with suitable shells. The female lays eggs inside the shell,
where she protects the fry until they are free-swimming. A separate breeding tank with stable conditions can help
increase the success rate of breeding.
