## Overview

**Desmopuntius rhomboocellatus**, commonly known as the Snakeskin Barb, is a stunningly patterned fish from the
Cyprinidae family. Native to the blackwater rivers and streams of Borneo, these barbs are characterized by their unique
diamond-shaped markings, which resemble the scales of a snake. They are peaceful schooling fish that are perfect for a
well-planted community tank.

## Tank Requirements

The Snakeskin Barb requires an aquarium with a minimum capacity of 70 liters (18 gallons). The ideal water temperature
ranges from 22-28°C (72-82°F), with a pH of 6.0-7.0 and general hardness (GH) between 4-15. These fish thrive in a soft,
slightly acidic environment with subdued lighting and plenty of plants. Driftwood and leaf litter can be added to
replicate their natural blackwater habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Desmopuntius rhomboocellatus** feed on small invertebrates and organic detritus. In captivity, they can
be fed a diet of high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen options such as brine shrimp,
daphnia, and bloodworms. They also enjoy vegetable matter like blanched spinach or spirulina flakes.

## Care and Maintenance

The Snakeskin Barb is relatively easy to care for, provided that stable water conditions are maintained. They should be
kept in groups of at least six, as they are schooling fish that feel more secure and exhibit better behavior when kept
together. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly will help ensure clean, well-oxygenated water.

## Compatibility

These peaceful barbs can be kept with a variety of other small, non-aggressive species such as tetras, rasboras, and
smaller cichlids. Avoid housing them with larger, more aggressive species that may bully or outcompete them for food.
Their calm nature makes them a perfect addition to a planted community aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding **Desmopuntius rhomboocellatus** in the aquarium is possible but can be a bit challenging. They are egg
scatterers, and successful spawning usually requires a well-planted tank with soft, slightly acidic water. The adults
should be removed after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch within 24-48 hours, and
the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food.
