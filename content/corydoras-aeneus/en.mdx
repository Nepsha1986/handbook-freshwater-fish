## Overview

Corydoras catfish (Corydoras aeneus) are small, peaceful bottom-dwelling fish known for their active and social
behavior. Originating from South America, these fish have a distinctive appearance with armored plates along their
bodies and barbels around their mouths. They are commonly found in slow-moving waters with soft substrates and ample
plant cover.

## Tank Requirements

Corydoras catfish thrive in a well-maintained tank with a minimum volume of 40 liters. The ideal water temperature for
corydoras is between 22-26°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.8 and a general hardness (GH) of 2-12. A soft substrate, such as
sand or smooth gravel, is essential to prevent damage to their delicate barbels. The tank should be equipped with a
gentle filter to maintain water quality and provide moderate water flow. Corydoras appreciate a tank setup with plenty
of hiding spots, such as plants, driftwood, and caves.

## Feeding and Diet

Corydoras catfish are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, consisting of small invertebrates, plant matter,
and detritus. In an aquarium, they can be fed a combination of sinking pellets or wafers, supplemented with live or
frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. They also help keep the tank clean by scavenging leftover
food from the substrate. Feeding them once or twice a day in small portions will ensure they get the necessary nutrients
without overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Corydoras catfish are hardy and relatively easy to care for. Perform regular water changes of about 20-30% weekly to
maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters frequently and clean the tank and filters as needed. Corydoras are
generally healthy, but they can be prone to diseases like fin rot and ich. Keeping the tank clean and maintaining stable
water conditions will help prevent these common health issues.

## Compatibility

Corydoras catfish are peaceful and make excellent tank mates for a variety of community fish. They are best kept in
groups of at least six to encourage natural social behaviors. Suitable tank mates include tetras, rasboras, gouramis,
and other non-aggressive species. Avoid keeping corydoras with large or aggressive fish that may see them as prey or
compete for food.

## Breeding

Breeding corydoras catfish can be a straightforward process in a well-maintained aquarium. To encourage breeding,
provide a separate breeding tank with slightly cooler water temperatures (around 22°C) and softer water. Simulate the
rainy season by performing frequent water changes with slightly cooler water. Look for signs of courtship behaviors such
as the T-position, where the male fertilizes the eggs held by the female. After laying eggs on flat surfaces like leaves
or tank glass, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days, and the fry can
be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
