## Overview

**Crossocheilus oblongus**, commonly known as the Siamese Algae Eater, is a freshwater fish native to the rivers and
streams of Southeast Asia. This species typically reaches a size of 10-15 cm and has a lifespan of 5 to 7 years.

Siamese Algae Eaters are well-regarded for their effective algae-eating habits, making them popular in community
aquariums. Their peaceful demeanor allows them to coexist harmoniously with a variety of tankmates.

## Tank Requirements

**Crossocheilus oblongus** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and a general
hardness (GH) between 5-15 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-28Â°C, and they should be housed in
a tank with a minimum volume of 150 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with ample swimming space is essential for these fish. They appreciate areas with moderate water
flow and hiding spots among plants and decorations.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Crossocheilus oblongus** are primarily herbivorous and feed on algae, plant matter, and detritus. In
captivity, they readily accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and blanched vegetables like zucchini or spinach.

To maintain their health, it's important to provide a varied diet that includes both algae-based and vegetable-based
foods. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, ensuring they consume their meals within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Siamese Algae Eaters are relatively easy to care for, but maintaining good water quality is crucial. Regular water
changes of 20-30% each week are recommended to keep the environment clean. A reliable filtration system helps keep the
water well-oxygenated.

These fish can be somewhat territorial as they mature, so providing plenty of hiding spots and space can help reduce
aggression.

## Compatibility

**Crossocheilus oblongus** are best kept with other peaceful fish that share similar water parameters. Suitable
tankmates include tetras, barbs, and other small community fish. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive species, as
this may lead to stress.

Their algae-eating abilities make them a beneficial addition to a community tank, helping to control algae growth while
contributing to the overall ecosystem.

## Breeding

Breeding **Crossocheilus oblongus** in captivity can be challenging. They are egg scatterers, and a separate breeding
tank with suitable spawning sites is recommended.

The eggs are adhesive and will stick to surfaces after spawning. Once the fry are free-swimming, they should be fed
infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to consume standard flake foods.
