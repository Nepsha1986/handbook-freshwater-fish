## Overview

Danio jaintianensis, also known as Jaintia Danio, is a beautiful and peaceful fish native to the streams and rivers of
the Jaintia Hills in India. Its striking blue and silver color pattern makes it a visually appealing addition to
community aquariums. Jaintia Danios are schooling fish, which means they thrive when kept in groups.

## Tank Requirements

Jaintia Danios require a tank of at least 50 liters. The water temperature should be kept between 22-26Â°C, with a pH of
6.5-7.5 and water hardness between 5-12 dGH. They prefer a well-planted aquarium with some open spaces for swimming,
along with a gentle current to simulate their natural environment. A fine gravel or sand substrate is ideal for these
fish.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Danio jaintianensis primarily feeds on small invertebrates and algae. In captivity, they will readily
accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flake food, micro-pellets, and live or frozen options like brine
shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Ensure that their diet is varied to maintain optimal health.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio jaintianensis is easy to care for, requiring regular water changes and good filtration to maintain water quality.
They are active swimmers and should be monitored for signs of stress or illness. Keep an eye on water parameters and
ensure the tank is clean to prevent diseases.

## Compatibility

Jaintia Danios are peaceful fish that get along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tank mates include tetras,
rasboras, and smaller corydoras. As schooling fish, they should be kept in groups of at least 6 to reduce stress and
encourage natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio jaintianensis can be done in captivity but requires some preparation. These fish are egg scatterers and
prefer a well-planted breeding tank. Once the eggs are laid, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The
eggs will hatch in 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food.
