## Overview

**Petitella rhodostomus**, commonly known as the Rummy-nose Tetra, is a small, peaceful, and strikingly patterned fish
native to the Amazon basin in South America. Its bright red snout and black-and-white striped tail make it instantly
recognizable, and its peaceful nature makes it a popular choice for community tanks. These fish typically grow to about
4.5-5 cm in length and have a lifespan of 5-6 years.

Rummy-nose Tetras are schooling fish that do best when kept in groups of at least 6-8 individuals. Their calm demeanor
and vibrant colors make them an excellent addition to peaceful community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

**Petitella rhodostomus** prefer soft, slightly acidic water with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0, and a general hardness (GH)
of 2-12 dGH. The ideal temperature range is 22-28°C, and they should be kept in a tank with a minimum volume of 80
liters.

Rummy-nose Tetras thrive in well-planted aquariums with subdued lighting, mimicking their natural environment in the
shaded areas of the Amazon. Adding driftwood and plants such as Java fern, Amazon sword, and floating plants can help
create a comfortable, natural habitat. Ensure the tank has a good filtration system to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Petitella rhodostomus** feed on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they will
accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, micro-pellets, frozen or live foods like daphnia, brine
shrimp, and bloodworms. To maintain their bright colors and overall health, it's essential to offer a varied diet with
both protein-rich and plant-based components.

Feed them small portions twice a day, making sure not to overfeed, as they have small stomachs and overfeeding can cause
health problems.

## Care and Maintenance

Rummy-nose Tetras are relatively easy to care for, but they are sensitive to poor water quality. Regular water changes
of 20-30% each week are crucial to maintain a healthy environment. A good filtration system is necessary to keep the
water clean and oxygenated, as they prefer well-oxygenated water.

Because they are sensitive to changes in water conditions, it's essential to monitor the water parameters frequently and
avoid sudden fluctuations in temperature or pH.

## Compatibility

**Petitella rhodostomus** are peaceful schooling fish that do well in a community aquarium with other small,
non-aggressive species. They are compatible with other tetras, rasboras, Corydoras catfish, and small peaceful cichlids
like Apistogramma.

It's important to keep them in groups of at least 6-8 individuals, as they can become stressed and lose their vibrant
colors if kept in smaller numbers. Their schooling behavior also makes them more comfortable and helps bring out their
natural beauty.

## Breeding

Breeding **Petitella rhodostomus** can be challenging but is possible in home aquariums. To encourage breeding, set up a
separate breeding tank with soft, acidic water and slightly warmer temperatures of around 26-28°C. Provide fine-leaved
plants or spawning mops where the female can lay her eggs.

Once the eggs are laid, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 24-36 hours,
and the fry can be fed on infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to accept baby brine shrimp.
