## Overview

**Esomus danrica**, commonly referred to as the **Indian Flying Barb**, is a slender and fast-swimming fish native to
rivers, streams, and ponds across South Asia. Known for its long barbels, this fish can grow up to 12-15 cm and is
highly active, often seen darting around the aquarium. It thrives in well-oxygenated tanks with plenty of swimming
space.

## Tank Requirements

The Indian Flying Barb requires a tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters, with water temperatures between 22-28Â°C. The
pH level should be kept between 6.0-7.5, and water hardness (GH) between 5-15. This species enjoys tanks with moderate
water flow and dense vegetation along with open spaces to swim freely.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Esomus danrica** feeds on small invertebrates, plankton, and plant matter. In captivity, it will accept a
variety of foods, including flakes, pellets, and live or frozen options like bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. A
varied diet is essential to support their active metabolism and maintain vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Esomus danrica is a relatively hardy species that is suitable for aquarists with some experience. Regular water changes
(20-30% weekly) are recommended to maintain water quality, as they are sensitive to poor water conditions. Ensuring
proper filtration and aeration is crucial for their health and longevity.

These fish are generally peaceful and can be kept in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. However, due to
their fast-swimming nature, they may outcompete slower tank mates for food. Suitable companions include tetras,
rasboras, and other fast
