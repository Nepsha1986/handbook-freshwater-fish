## Overview

**Poecilia wingei**, commonly known as Endler's Livebearer, is a small and colorful freshwater fish native to the
lagoons and marshes of Venezuela. These fish are known for their vibrant coloration, with males displaying bright
patterns of orange, blue, and green, while females are larger and more subdued in color. They typically grow to about
3-4 cm in length and have a lifespan of 2-4 years.

Endler's Livebearers are peaceful and social fish, making them suitable for community tanks. They are often kept with
other small, non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

**Poecilia wingei** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water conditions with a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5 and a general
hardness (GH) of 10-25 dGH. The ideal temperature range is between 24-28°C, and they should be housed in a tank with a
minimum volume of 60 liters.

Providing a well-planted aquarium with open swimming spaces and hiding spots is essential for their well-being. They
enjoy a variety of substrates and can adapt to different tank setups.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Poecilia wingei** primarily feed on algae, detritus, and small invertebrates. In captivity, they accept a
variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, micro-pellets, and live or frozen foods like brine shrimp and daphnia.

To maintain their health and vibrant colors, feed them a balanced diet with a mix of plant-based and protein-rich foods.
Feed small portions 2-3 times a day, ensuring they consume all food within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Endler's Livebearers are relatively easy to care for but are sensitive to poor water quality. Regular water changes of
20-30% each week are essential for maintaining a healthy environment. A good filtration system is necessary to keep the
water clean and well-oxygenated.

These fish can be kept in groups, and a ratio of one male to several females is recommended to reduce stress and
aggression among males during breeding.

## Compatibility

**Poecilia wingei** are generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tankmates
include tetras, rasboras, and other small livebearers. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species, as they may
become stressed or bullied.

Providing plenty of hiding spots and open swimming areas will help maintain a peaceful environment for these active and
social fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Poecilia wingei** is straightforward, as they are livebearers. To encourage breeding, provide ample hiding
spots and plants where females can give birth safely.

After a gestation period of about 4-6 weeks, females will give birth to live fry. The fry can be fed with finely crushed
flakes or specialized fry food. It’s important to separate the fry from adult fish to prevent them from being eaten.
