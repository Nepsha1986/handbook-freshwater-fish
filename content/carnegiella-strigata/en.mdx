## Overview

The Marbled Hatchetfish (Carnegiella strigata) is a unique, surface-dwelling fish from the Gasteropelecidae family,
native to the slow-moving streams and flooded forests of the Amazon Basin. It is named for its distinctive
hatchet-shaped body, which allows it to glide short distances above the water surface, a behavior known as 'skipping.'
These small fish, typically reaching 3-4 cm in length, have a marbled pattern of silver and black on their bodies. They
are peaceful and best kept in groups, making them suitable for community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.

## Tank Requirements

Marbled Hatchetfish thrive in well-planted aquariums with a tight-fitting lid to prevent them from jumping out. A tank
of at least 60 liters is recommended, with water temperatures maintained between 24-28Â°C. The water should be soft to
moderately hard, with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 and general hardness (GH) of 2-15. These fish prefer a dimly lit environment
with floating plants to diffuse the light and provide them with a sense of security. A gentle water flow is ideal,
replicating their natural habitat of slow-moving waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Marbled Hatchetfish feed primarily on insects and small invertebrates that they catch at the water's
surface. In captivity, they should be offered a diet consisting of high-quality flake foods, micro pellets, and
freeze-dried or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and mosquito larvae. Feeding should be done once or twice
daily, ensuring that all food is consumed within a few minutes. Due to their surface-dwelling nature, they are best fed
floating foods to mimic their natural feeding behavior.

## Care and Maintenance

Carnegiella strigata are relatively easy to care for, provided their tank is secure and their water conditions are
stable. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are important to maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters
closely, as these fish are sensitive to sudden changes in water chemistry. They are prone to common freshwater diseases,
such as ich, so it's essential to observe them regularly for any signs of illness. Maintaining a clean tank with stable
conditions and a proper diet will help keep them healthy.

## Compatibility

Marbled Hatchetfish are peaceful and do well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species. Ideal tank
mates include tetras, rasboras, dwarf cichlids, and small catfish. Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive species
that may bully or prey on them. It's recommended to keep them in groups of six or more, as they are schooling fish that
feel more secure in numbers. Ensure that the tank has plenty of cover at the surface, such as floating plants, to help
reduce stress and prevent jumping.

## Breeding

Breeding Marbled Hatchetfish in captivity is challenging due to their specific requirements. They are egg scatterers,
and breeding typically occurs during the rainy season in their natural habitat. To encourage spawning, simulate these
conditions by gradually lowering the water level, increasing the temperature slightly, and providing plenty of live
food. The female will scatter eggs among floating plants, and the male will fertilize them. Once the eggs are laid,
remove the parents to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 24-36 hours, and the fry can be
fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to accept finely crushed flake food.
