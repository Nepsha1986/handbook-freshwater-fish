## Overview

**Corydoras panda**, commonly referred to as the Panda Corydoras, is a popular freshwater catfish native to the Amazon
Basin in South America. This species typically grows to a size of 5-6 cm and has a lifespan of 3 to 5 years.

These sociable catfish are often seen swimming in groups, making them a delightful addition to community aquariums.
Their unique coloration and playful behavior contribute to their popularity among aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

**Corydoras panda** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 and a general hardness (GH)
between 2-12 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 22-26Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank with a
minimum volume of 100 liters.

A well-planted aquarium with a soft substrate, such as sand, is ideal for these fish, as they enjoy foraging for food.
Providing ample hiding spots and open swimming areas will help keep them happy and healthy.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Corydoras panda** are omnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates, detritus, and plant matter. In
captivity, they readily accept high-quality sinking pellets, flakes, and frozen or live foods like brine shrimp and
bloodworms.

To ensure their health, it is essential to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and vegetable-based
foods. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, with portions they can consume within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining optimal water conditions is crucial for **Corydoras panda**. Regular water changes of 20-30% per week are
recommended to keep the water clean and stable. A reliable filtration system is essential for maintaining good water
quality.

These fish prefer a well-oxygenated environment, so providing adequate aeration through a sponge filter or air stones
can be beneficial. Monitoring water parameters closely will help prevent stress and disease.

## Compatibility

**Corydoras panda** are peaceful fish that can be kept with various community tankmates. Suitable companions include
small tetras, rasboras, and other peaceful species that share similar water requirements.

Avoid keeping them with aggressive or large fish, as they may be bullied or outcompeted for food. Ensuring a spacious
environment with plenty of hiding spots will help reduce stress and aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Corydoras panda** in captivity can be rewarding but requires some preparation. They are egg layers and
typically spawn on flat surfaces in the aquarium.

Setting up a breeding tank with gentle filtration and plenty of hiding places will encourage spawning behavior. Once the
eggs are laid, they should be removed to prevent them from being eaten by the parents. Fry can be fed infusoria or
finely crushed flakes once they are free-swimming.
