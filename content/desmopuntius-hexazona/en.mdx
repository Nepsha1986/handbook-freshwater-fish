## Overview

**Desmopuntius hexazona**, commonly known as the **Six-banded Barb**, is a small, peaceful freshwater fish native to
streams and rivers in Southeast Asia. Its most distinguishing feature is the six black vertical bands running along its
silver body. This attractive species grows to around 5-6 cm in length and thrives in well-planted community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Six-banded Barbs prefer water temperatures between 23-28°C and thrive in tanks with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They
require a pH level between 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) from 5-12. They enjoy densely planted tanks with open
swimming areas. A moderate water flow with good filtration is recommended to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Desmopuntius hexazona** feeds on small insects, larvae, and plant matter. In captivity, they will readily
accept a varied diet of high-quality flakes, pellets, and live or frozen foods like daphnia, brine shrimp, and
bloodworms. It’s important to offer them a mix of plant-based and protein-rich foods to maintain optimal health and
color.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Six-banded Barb is straightforward, making it suitable for beginners. They are hardy fish but require
regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and good water quality. They are also sensitive to sudden changes in water
parameters, so it is crucial to maintain stable conditions. Monitoring water temperature and pH levels is essential.

## Compatibility

Six-banded Barbs are peaceful and social fish that should be kept in groups of at least six to promote their natural
schooling behavior. They make excellent tank mates for other peaceful species such as tetras, rasboras, and small
gouramis. Avoid housing them with aggressive or fin-nipping species to prevent stress and injury.

## Breeding

Breeding **Desmopuntius hexazona** can be moderately challenging. They are egg scatterers and require slightly warmer
water (around 26-28°C) for spawning. Provide fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop for the eggs to settle. Remove the
adults once spawning is complete, as they may eat the eggs. The eggs will hatch within 24-48 hours, and the fry can be
fed
