## Overview

**Herichthys carpintis**, also known as the Green Texas Cichlid or Pearlscale Cichlid, is a large, striking fish from
the rivers of northeastern Mexico. Known for their iridescent green and blue scales, they are popular in the aquarium
hobby but require experienced care due to their territorial and aggressive behavior.

Herichthys carpintis can grow to sizes between 15-30 cm and have a lifespan of 10-12 years. Their aggressive nature
means they are best suited for species-only tanks or with other large, equally aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

Due to their size and territorial behavior, a large aquarium of at least 300 liters is recommended for **Herichthys
carpintis**. They prefer a water temperature of 24-28°C, moderately hard to hard water with a GH of 8-20, and a pH range
of 6.5-8.0.

Providing ample hiding spots, rocks, and driftwood is essential to create territorial boundaries. A powerful filtration
system is also necessary to maintain clean water conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

**Herichthys carpintis** are omnivores and enjoy a varied diet of high-quality pellets or flakes supplemented with live
or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, and small insects. Occasional vegetable matter, such as blanched spinach
or peas, can also be provided to balance their diet.

Feeding them multiple times a day in small quantities will help maintain their health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Herichthys carpintis** requires attention to water quality, as they are sensitive to poor conditions.
Regular water changes and monitoring water parameters are crucial for their long-term health.

Due to their aggressive nature, they may dig in the substrate and uproot plants, so choosing hardy plants like java fern
or using rocks and driftwood as décor is advisable.

## Compatibility

**Herichthys carpintis** are aggressive, territorial fish, making them unsuitable for community tanks. They do best with
similarly sized, robust species, such as other large cichlids. Avoid housing them with smaller, more passive fish as
they may become targets of aggression.

It's recommended to keep them in a large tank where they can establish territories and minimize conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding **Herichthys carpintis** can be challenging due to their aggressive behavior. They are substrate spawners,
meaning the female will lay eggs on flat surfaces like rocks. Both parents will guard the eggs and fry aggressively, so
providing ample space and hiding spots for tankmates is crucial.

The fry hatch within 2-3 days, and both parents will care for the fry, guiding them around the tank. It’s important to
feed the fry with finely crushed flake food or baby brine shrimp as they grow.
