## Overview

**Aspidoras pauciradiatus**, commonly known as the Dwarf Aspidoras or False Corydoras, is a small catfish species
belonging to the Callichthyidae family. Native to the Amazon River basin, this species attracts aquarists with its
compact size (only 3-4 cm in length), peaceful nature, and hardiness. The Dwarf Aspidoras is perfect for small aquariums
and community tanks with other small, peaceful fish.

Males and females of this species look similar, but females are usually slightly larger and have a rounder belly. The
lifespan of the Dwarf Aspidoras in captivity is 3-5 years with proper care. Their modest yet elegant appearance, along
with their active behavior, makes them an excellent choice for aquarists of all experience levels.

## Aquarium Requirements

To keep Dwarf Aspidoras, you’ll need an aquarium with a minimum volume of **40 liters**. These are schooling fish, so
it’s recommended to keep them in groups of at least 6 individuals. Optimal water parameters are:

- **Temperature:** 22-28°C
- **pH:** 6.0-7.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 2-15 dGH

### Aquarium Setup:

1. **Substrate:** Fine sand or smooth gravel. Coarse substrates can damage their sensitive barbels.
2. **Hiding Places:** Driftwood, rocks, coconut shells, and dense plant cover (e.g., Java moss, Anubias, or
   Cryptocoryne).
3. **Lighting:** Dim lighting, as Dwarf Aspidoras prefer soft light.
4. **Filtration and Flow:** Moderate water flow and high-quality filtration. These fish prefer clean water but can be
   stressed by strong currents.

**Tip:** Use live plants like Java moss or Anubias to create a natural environment and provide additional hiding spots.

## Diet and Feeding

Dwarf Aspidoras are omnivorous and feed on small invertebrates, detritus, and plant matter in the wild. In an aquarium,
their diet should be varied and balanced:

- **Staple Food:** Sinking pellets or tablets for bottom-dwelling fish (e.g., Tetra Tablets TabiMin or Sera Vipagran).
- **Supplemental Foods:**
- Live or frozen foods (bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, tubifex).
- Vegetable matter: blanched spinach, zucchini, or cucumber.
- **Feeding Frequency:** 1-2 times daily.

**Important:** Ensure the food reaches the bottom, as Dwarf Aspidoras rarely surface to feed.

## Care and Maintenance

Dwarf Aspidoras are relatively low-maintenance, but maintaining high water quality is essential for their health. Key
recommendations include:

- **Water Changes:** Replace 20-30% of the water weekly.
- **Substrate Cleaning:** Use a siphon to remove leftover food and waste.
- **Water Testing:** Regularly check ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.
- **Aeration:** Ensure good oxygenation, as these fish thrive in well-oxygenated water.

**Tip:** Avoid sudden changes in water parameters, such as pH or temperature fluctuations, to prevent stress.

## Compatibility

Dwarf Aspidoras are peaceful fish that get along well with other small, non-aggressive species. Ideal tank mates
include:

- **Small Tetras** (neons, rummy-nose tetras).
- **Rasboras**.
- **Dwarf Cichlids** (Apistogramma).
- **Other Peaceful Bottom-Dwellers** (Corydoras, Otocinclus).

**Avoid** keeping them with large or aggressive fish, such as cichlids or barbs, as they may compete for food or harm
the Dwarf Aspidoras.

## Breeding

Breeding Dwarf Aspidoras in captivity is possible but requires preparation:

- **Breeding Tank:** A separate tank of 20-30 liters with soft substrate and hiding spots.
- **Water Parameters:** Temperature 26-28°C, pH 6.0-6.5, soft water.
- **Spawning Triggers:** Frequent small water changes (10-15% daily) and increased protein-rich foods.
- **Spawning:** Females lay eggs on flat surfaces (leaves, glass). After spawning, remove the parents to prevent them
  from eating the eggs.
- **Fry Care:** Eggs hatch in 3-5 days. Feed the fry infusoria initially, then transition to micro-worms and crushed
  flakes.

**Tip:** If you’re a beginner, start by keeping adult fish before attempting breeding.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Loss of Activity or Appetite:**

- Check water quality and parameters (temperature, pH, ammonia).
- Ensure the fish are not stressed by aggressive tank mates.

2. **Damaged Barbels:**

- Use a soft substrate (sand or fine gravel).
- Avoid sharp decorations.

3. **Stress in Fish:**

- Ensure the tank is spacious and has plenty of hiding spots.
- Avoid sudden changes in water conditions.

## Conclusion

The Dwarf Aspidoras (False Corydoras) is an ideal choice for anyone looking to add life and activity to the bottom of
their aquarium. Their hardiness, peaceful nature, and interesting behavior make them excellent pets for both beginners
and experienced aquarists. Provide them with a comfortable environment, and they will reward you with their lively
presence and health for years to come!
