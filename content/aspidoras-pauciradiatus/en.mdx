## Overview

**Aspidoras pauciradiatus**, also known as the Dwarf Aspidoras, is a small, peaceful catfish species from the family
Callichthyidae. This species is native to the Amazon Basin, where it inhabits slow-moving streams and flooded forest
areas. Aspidoras pauciradiatus is a bottom-dweller that typically reaches a size of 3-4 cm (1.2-1.6 inches) and has a
lifespan of 3-5 years in captivity. It is known for its gentle nature and is an excellent choice for community
aquariums, especially those with other small, peaceful fish.

## Tank Requirements

The Dwarf Aspidoras requires a tank that replicates its natural habitat, with a minimum volume of 40 liters (10
gallons). The ideal water temperature ranges between 22-28째C (72-82째F), with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and general hardness (GH)
of 2-15. A fine, sandy substrate is preferred to protect their delicate barbels, which they use to forage for food. The
tank should be decorated with plenty of hiding places such as driftwood, rocks, and aquatic plants to provide security
and reduce stress. Adequate water flow and efficient filtration are important to maintain high water quality and
oxygenation.

## Feeding and Diet

Aspidoras pauciradiatus are omnivores and should be provided with a varied diet for optimal health. In the wild, they
feed on small invertebrates, plant matter, and detritus. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality sinking pellets,
along with frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Offering occasional vegetable matter,
like blanched spinach or zucchini, can help mimic their natural diet and ensure balanced nutrition.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Aspidoras pauciradiatus is relatively easy, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular maintenance,
including weekly water changes of 20-30%, is necessary to keep the tank environment clean and stable. Ensure the
substrate is soft and smooth to prevent injury to their sensitive barbels. A calm and peaceful tank environment with
minimal disturbances is ideal to keep these fish stress-free and healthy.

## Compatibility

The Dwarf Aspidoras is a peaceful species and does well in a community tank with other small, non-aggressive fish. It is
best kept in groups of at least 6 individuals to promote natural schooling behavior and reduce stress. Compatible tank
mates include small tetras, rasboras, dwarf cichlids, and other peaceful bottom dwellers. Avoid keeping them with large
or aggressive fish that may outcompete them for food or cause harm.

## Breeding

Breeding Aspidoras pauciradiatus in captivity can be challenging but achievable with the right conditions. To encourage
spawning, maintain stable water conditions with plenty of hiding spots and a slightly elevated water temperature of
around 26-28째C (79-82째F). Frequent small water changes may also help stimulate breeding behavior. The female typically
lays eggs on flat surfaces such as leaves or the aquarium glass. Parents do not exhibit parental care, so it's advisable
to move the eggs to a separate breeding tank to protect them from being eaten by other fish. The eggs hatch within 3-5
days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or specially formulated fry food until they are large enough to consume crushed
flakes or micro-worms.
