## Overview

_Pangasius sutchi_, commonly known as the Sutchi Catfish or Striped Catfish, is a large freshwater fish native to the
rivers and lakes of Southeast Asia. This species is notable for its impressive size, reaching up to 90 cm in length, and
its peaceful nature. The Sutchi Catfish is characterized by its elongated body, forked tail, and distinctive horizontal
stripes that give it a striking appearance.

## Tank Requirements

Due to its large size, _Pangasius sutchi_ requires a very spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 500 liters. They
prefer a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as
sand or fine gravel, and include ample swimming space along with some hiding spots and decorations. A robust filtration
system is crucial to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Sutchi Catfish_ is an omnivorous species that feeds on a variety of foods in the wild, including small fish,
invertebrates, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods
such as worms, shrimp, and small fish. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and support their growth.
Feed them once or twice a day with portions appropriate to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Sutchi Catfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are
relatively easy to care for but require a large tank to accommodate their size and swimming needs. Regular water changes
and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Their peaceful
nature makes them suitable for large community tanks with other non-aggressive species.

## Compatibility

_Pangasius sutchi_ is a generally peaceful fish but can become territorial as it grows. They are best kept with other
large, non-aggressive species that can tolerate similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates include other large
catfish, large characins, and certain species of cichlids. Avoid housing them with small or overly aggressive fish, as
they may become stressed or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pangasius sutchi_ in captivity is challenging and rarely achieved due to the size and specific conditions
required. They are egg-scattering fish, and successful breeding involves providing a large tank with plenty of space and
a well-maintained environment. To promote breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and ensure good water quality.
The eggs will be scattered and incubated in the tank, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they
are free-swimming. Proper care and monitoring are crucial for successful breeding and healthy fry.
