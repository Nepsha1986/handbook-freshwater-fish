## Overview

The Glass Bloodfin (Prionobrama filigera) is a small, peaceful species belonging to the Characidae family. This fish is
native to the slow-moving waters of the Amazon Basin in South America. Known for its translucent body, the Glass
Bloodfin has a delicate appearance with a shimmering, silvery sheen. They typically grow to about 4-6 cm in length and
are best kept in schools of six or more. Their peaceful nature and striking appearance make them an excellent choice for
community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Glass Bloodfins thrive in well-maintained aquariums with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They prefer a water temperature
between 22-26°C, with a pH level ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 and a water hardness (GH) of 5-15. These fish enjoy a planted
tank with plenty of swimming space, as well as hiding spots created by driftwood and rocks. A gentle filter is
recommended to simulate their natural habitat of slow-moving waters. It's important to maintain high water quality
through regular water changes and monitoring.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Glass Bloodfins feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In captivity, they are not picky eaters and
will readily accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flake foods, micro-pellets, and live or frozen foods like
daphnia, brine shrimp, or bloodworms. Feeding them a varied diet will enhance their color and ensure they receive all
necessary nutrients. Feed them small amounts 2-3 times a day.

## Care and Maintenance

Glass Bloodfins are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for both beginner and experienced aquarists.
Perform regular water changes of 20-30% weekly to maintain optimal water conditions. Their translucent bodies make them
sensitive to sudden changes in water parameters, so it's essential to keep the environment stable. Monitor their health
regularly and watch for signs of stress or disease, which can be treated with appropriate medication if detected early.

## Compatibility

Glass Bloodfins are peaceful and get along well with other small, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tank mates include other
small tetras, rasboras, corydoras, and peaceful dwarf cichlids. They are schooling fish and should be kept in groups of
at least six to make them feel secure and display their natural behavior. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive
species, as they can easily become stressed or injured.

## Breeding

Breeding Glass Bloodfins in captivity can be achieved with the right conditions. They are egg scatterers, and spawning
is usually triggered by increasing the water temperature slightly to 26-28°C and providing a separate breeding tank with
fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop. After spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs.
The eggs typically hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes once they become
free-swimming.
