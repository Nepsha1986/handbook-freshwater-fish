## Overview

**Labeotropheus trewavasae**, commonly known as the Trewavasae Cichlid, is a popular mbuna cichlid species from Lake
Malawi in Africa. This fish is recognized for its elongated body shape, unique color patterns, and active personality.
Native to rocky shorelines, it spends its time grazing on algae.

## Tank Requirements

To keep Labeotropheus trewavasae, an aquarium of at least 150 liters is needed. The tank should mimic its natural rocky
habitat with plenty of caves and hiding spots. Maintain water temperatures between 23-28Â°C with a pH of 7.5-8.5 and a
water hardness of 10-20 dGH. A high-quality filtration system is essential to ensure water clarity and stability.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, this species primarily grazes on algae and other plant matter. In captivity, they should be fed a diet rich
in spirulina-based flakes, vegetable matter, and occasional protein. Avoid high-protein foods like bloodworms to prevent
digestive issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Labeotropheus trewavasae requires consistent water changes to maintain pristine water conditions. Weekly water changes
of at least 25% are recommended. Monitor the fish for signs of stress or illness, such as faded colors or reduced
appetite.

## Compatibility

This species is semi-aggressive and territorial, especially during breeding. It is best kept with other mbuna cichlids
of similar size and temperament. Avoid housing them with overly aggressive or timid fish. Maintain a group of one male
with multiple females to reduce aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding this species requires a separate tank with optimal water parameters. The male will prepare a spawning site,
usually within a rocky cave. After spawning, the female will mouthbrood the eggs for 18-21 days before releasing the
fry. Provide finely crushed spirulina flakes or baby brine shrimp for the fry's first feedings.
