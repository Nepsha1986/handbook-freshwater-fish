## Overview

**Hyphessobrycon roseus**, commonly known as the Rosy Tetra, is a striking freshwater fish with a reddish-pink hue. It
is a popular choice among aquarists due to its peaceful temperament and ease of care. This small fish, reaching about
3-4 cm in length, is ideal for planted community aquariums.

With a lifespan of 3-5 years, **Hyphessobrycon roseus** is relatively easy to maintain, making it suitable for beginners
and experienced aquarists alike. They thrive in groups and should be kept with other peaceful fish species.

## Tank Requirements

**Hyphessobrycon roseus** prefers a well-planted aquarium with a minimum volume of 40 liters. The water temperature
should be kept between 22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 5.5-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 2-12. Soft, slightly acidic
water mimics their natural habitat.

A gentle filter is recommended to avoid strong currents, as Rosy Tetras prefer calm waters. Including plants and
driftwood will provide shelter and enhance their natural coloration.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Hyphessobrycon roseus** feeds on small insects, invertebrates, and plant matter. In the aquarium, they
readily accept a variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, micro-pellets, and live or frozen foods such as
daphnia, brine shrimp, and bloodworms. A varied diet helps them maintain their vibrant colors.

## Care and Maintenance

**Hyphessobrycon roseus** is a hardy species, but stable water parameters are key to their well-being. Regular water
changes and maintaining proper filtration will keep them healthy. They do best in peaceful community tanks and should be
housed with other small, non-aggressive fish.

Since they are schooling fish, it's important to keep them in groups of at least six to ensure they feel secure. This
also allows them to display their natural behaviors and vibrant colors.

## Compatibility

**Hyphessobrycon roseus** is a peaceful and social species. Ideal tank mates include other small tetras, rasboras, and
peaceful bottom dwellers like Corydoras catfish. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish that may cause stress
or harm.

They thrive in community aquariums with other fish of similar size and temperament. In a well-maintained setup, they
will bring lively movement and color to the tank.

## Breeding

Breeding **Hyphessobrycon roseus** can be done in a separate breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water. The fish
are egg scatterers, and females will lay eggs on fine-leaved plants. After spawning, it is important to remove the
adults, as they may eat the eggs.

The eggs will hatch within 24-36 hours, and the fry will become free-swimming in about 4-5 days. Fry should be fed
infusoria or other microfoods until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp or crushed flakes.
