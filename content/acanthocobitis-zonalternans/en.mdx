## Introduction

Acanthocobitis zonalternans, also referred to as the Zebra Loach or Striped Loach, is a small freshwater fish native to
the fast-flowing streams and rivers of Southeast Asia. Known for its vibrant appearance and lively behavior, this
species has become a favorite among aquarium enthusiasts. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know
about keeping, feeding, and breeding this fascinating fish.

## Appearance and Behavior

The Zebra Loach is easily recognizable by its bold black-and-white striped pattern, which resembles the stripes of a
zebra. Adults typically grow to a length of 2–3 inches (5–8 cm), making them well-suited for small to medium-sized
aquariums.

This species is highly active and inquisitive, spending most of its time exploring the bottom of the tank. Zebra Loaches
are social creatures and thrive in groups of 4–6 individuals. When kept in groups, they exhibit more natural behaviors
and feel more secure in their environment.

## Aquarium Requirements

### Water Parameters

- **Tank Size**: A minimum tank size of 15 gallons (60 liters) is recommended for a group of Zebra Loaches. For larger
  groups or community tanks, a 25-gallon (100-liter) tank or larger is ideal.
- **Temperature**: 72–79°F (22–26°C).
- **pH**: 6.5–7.5.
- **Water Hardness (GH)**: 5–12 dGH.

### Tank Setup

Zebra Loaches prefer aquariums with soft substrates, such as sand or fine gravel, to protect their delicate barbels.
Provide plenty of hiding spots using rocks, driftwood, and live plants. These elements help mimic their natural habitat
and reduce stress.

Moderate to strong water flow is recommended to replicate the fast-moving streams they inhabit. A powerhead or
adjustable filter can help achieve this.

### Filtration and Water Changes

Zebra Loaches are sensitive to water quality, so efficient filtration and regular water changes are essential. Perform
weekly water changes of 20–25% to maintain optimal water conditions and remove toxins.

## Feeding

In the wild, Zebra Loaches feed on small invertebrates, algae, and organic detritus. In captivity, their diet should be
varied and include:

- **Sinking pellets** and **algae wafers**.
- **Live or frozen foods**: bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.
- **Vegetables**: blanched zucchini, cucumber, or spinach (in small amounts).

Feed them 1–2 times daily in small portions to prevent overfeeding and maintain water quality. Ensure the food reaches
the bottom of the tank, as Zebra Loaches rarely surface to feed.

## Compatibility with Other Fish

Zebra Loaches are peaceful and get along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tankmates include:

- **Tetras** (neons, rummy noses).
- **Rasboras**.
- **Small gouramis**.
- **Corydoras** and other peaceful bottom-dwellers.

Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, such as cichlids, which may intimidate or harm the loaches.

## Breeding

Breeding Zebra Loaches in captivity is challenging and rarely achieved in home aquariums. However, if you’re up for the
challenge, here are some steps to encourage spawning:

1. **Breeding Tank**: Set up a separate 5–10 gallon (20–30 liter) tank with soft water (pH 6.0–6.5) and a temperature of
   79°F (26°C).
2. **Spawning Substrate**: Use fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop for egg deposition.
3. **Triggering Spawning**: Increase the temperature slightly and provide plenty of live foods to condition the fish.
4. **Spawning**: After the eggs are laid, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs.
5. **Raising Fry**: The eggs will hatch in 2–3 days. Feed the fry infusoria or freshly hatched brine shrimp.

## Conclusion

Acanthocobitis zonalternans, the Zebra Loach, is a stunning and lively addition to any community aquarium. With their
striking appearance and peaceful nature, these fish are sure to captivate any aquarist. By following the care guidelines
outlined above, you can ensure your Zebra Loaches thrive and bring joy to your aquarium for years to come.
