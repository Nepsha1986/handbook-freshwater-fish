## Overview

**Rasbora brigittae**, commonly known as the Chili Rasbora or Mosquito Rasbora, is a small freshwater fish belonging to
the family Cyprinidae. Native to the blackwater streams and peat swamps of Borneo, Indonesia, this species is highly
prized in the aquarium hobby for its vivid red coloration and peaceful nature. The Chili Rasbora is an excellent choice
for nano aquariums and densely planted tanks, where its colors can truly shine. Despite its small size, this fish is
active and prefers to be kept in groups, displaying schooling behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Chili Rasboras thrive in a well-planted aquarium with a minimum volume of 30 liters (approximately 8 gallons). The water
should be soft and acidic, with a pH between 4.0-6.5 and general hardness (GH) of 1-5. The ideal temperature range is
22-28°C (72-82°F). These fish are native to blackwater environments, so incorporating tannin-rich elements such as
driftwood or Indian almond leaves can help replicate their natural habitat and promote vibrant colors. A dark substrate
and subdued lighting will enhance their appearance and reduce stress.

## Feeding and Diet

**Rasbora brigittae** are micropredators and primarily feed on small invertebrates in the wild. In an aquarium setting,
they can be fed a diet of high-quality micro pellets or flakes, along with live or frozen foods such as daphnia,
cyclops, and baby brine shrimp. These foods help to replicate their natural diet and encourage natural foraging
behavior. Due to their small size, it's essential to offer appropriately sized foods to prevent choking and ensure all
fish can feed effectively.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining water quality is crucial for the health of Chili Rasboras. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
recommended to keep the water clean and stable. Because these fish are sensitive to changes in water parameters, it's
essential to perform gradual water changes to avoid shocking them. A gentle filtration system that provides minimal
water flow is ideal, as these fish prefer calm waters similar to their natural habitats. Regularly monitor water
parameters to ensure they remain within the ideal range for this species.

## Compatibility

Chili Rasboras are peaceful and can be housed with other small, non-aggressive fish in a community tank. Ideal tank
mates include other small rasboras, tetras, pygmy Corydoras, and small shrimp species. Due to their small size, they
should not be kept with larger or more aggressive fish that may see them as prey. Keeping them in groups of at least
8-10 individuals will promote natural schooling behavior and reduce stress, enhancing their color and activity levels.

## Breeding

Breeding **Rasbora brigittae** in captivity can be achieved with some effort. These fish are egg scatterers, and
breeding can be encouraged by setting up a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for the eggs
to settle in. To condition the breeding pair, feed them a diet rich in live and frozen foods. Once the eggs are laid,
the parents should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry
can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to accept micro-pellets or powdered fry food.
