## Overview

**Apistogramma viejita** is a small and vividly colored dwarf cichlid species from South America. The males are more
colorful, with red, orange, and blue hues, making them a popular choice for aquarists who want a visually striking fish.
They are peaceful and can coexist with other small, non-aggressive species in a well-maintained community aquarium.
These fish usually reach a size of 5-6 cm and have a lifespan of about 4-6 years under proper care.

## Tank Requirements

**Apistogramma viejita** requires a minimum tank size of 50 liters. The ideal water temperature for this species is
between 24-28Â°C, with a pH range of 5.0-7.0 and water hardness (GH) between 1-10. The tank should have plenty of plants,
hiding places, and soft substrate to mimic their natural environment. Dim lighting and slightly acidic water are
preferred to keep them comfortable.

## Feeding and Diet

This species is omnivorous and thrives on a varied diet. A combination of high-quality pellets, live, or frozen foods
such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia will keep them healthy and vibrant. Supplementing their diet with
vegetable matter, like spirulina, will benefit their overall health. A diverse diet helps them maintain their vibrant
colors.

## Care and Maintenance

While **Apistogramma viejita** is relatively easy to care for, it's important to maintain stable water conditions and
perform regular water changes. Keep the water clean and well-oxygenated with moderate filtration. Their peaceful
temperament makes them suitable for community tanks, but they are sensitive to poor water quality, so consistent
maintenance is crucial.

## Compatibility

**Apistogramma viejita** can be housed with other peaceful, small species such as tetras, rasboras, and catfish. They
are generally non-aggressive, but males may become territorial during breeding. Provide plenty of hiding spots to
minimize aggression and stress.

## Breeding

Breeding **Apistogramma viejita** is relatively easy in the right conditions. They are cave spawners, and the female
will lay eggs in a hidden place such as a small cave or under driftwood. The female tends to the eggs while the male
guards the territory. Eggs hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry become free-swimming after a week. Feed the fry with
infusoria or other small, high-protein foods.
