## Overview

_Apistogramma viejita_ is a dwarf cichlid from the family Cichlidae, endemic to the Meta River basin in the Colombian
Llanos. In the wild, these fish inhabit shallow forest streams and backwaters with soft, acidic water, where the bottom
is covered in fallen leaves and submerged branches.

Males of _A. viejita_ reach 5–6 cm and possess one of the most impressive colorations among dwarf cichlids: the body is
adorned with vivid red-orange and blue tones with a characteristic speckled pattern, while elongated rays on the dorsal
and caudal fins give them a particularly elegant appearance. Females are smaller, colored in yellow-grey tones with a
dark lateral stripe that becomes more contrasting during spawning. Lifespan is 4–6 years with proper care.

In temperament, _A. viejita_ is one of the most peaceful [Apistogramma](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides) species, making it
an excellent choice for community tanks with small, gentle fish.

## Tank Requirements

A pair of _Apistogramma viejita_ can be comfortably housed in a tank of at least 50 liters. Optimal water parameters
are: temperature 24–28 °C, pH 5.0–7.0, and general hardness (GH) 1–10. The fish feel most comfortable and display their
brightest colors in soft, slightly acidic water with a pH of 5.5–6.5.

Use fine, dark substrate — sand or small gravel — against which the fish's coloration looks especially striking. The
tank should be furnished with numerous hiding spots: ceramic caves, coconut shells, piles of driftwood, and dense
low-growing plants. Floating plants will create subdued lighting close to their natural conditions.

Indian almond or oak leaves on the bottom will tint the water a light amber and release tannins that create a beneficial
environment. Water flow should be gentle — a sponge filter is the ideal choice.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apistogramma viejita_ is an omnivorous species with a strong preference for animal-based foods. The core diet should
consist of live and frozen foods: brine shrimp, bloodworms, daphnia, cyclops, and grindal worms. Live foods produce the
most vivid and intense coloration.

High-quality micro granules for dwarf cichlids can supplement but should not replace the main diet. Feed small portions
twice daily — these fish prefer to forage from the bottom and mid-water rather than the surface.

Dietary variety is key to health and longevity. When preparing for breeding, increase the proportion of live foods —
this is a powerful spawning trigger.

## Care and Maintenance

_Apistogramma viejita_ is sensitive to water quality, requiring regular and attentive care. Weekly water changes of
20–25% will help maintain stable parameters. Monitor ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels using test kits — nitrates
should be kept below 20 mg/l.

Filtration should be effective yet gentle. A sponge filter provides excellent biological filtration without creating
stressful currents. Vacuum the substrate carefully, avoiding disruption of established territories and shelters.

Watch for signs of health: vibrant coloration and active bottom exploration indicate well-being. Fading colors, clamped
fins, or loss of appetite signal water quality issues or the onset of illness. Under stable conditions, _A. viejita_
rarely falls ill.

## Compatibility

_Apistogramma viejita_ coexists beautifully with small, peaceful species from the middle and upper water layers. Ideal
tank mates include small tetras such as [neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi),
[glowlight tetras](/en/hemigrammus-erythrozonus), and [ember tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae), as well as small
catfish like [pygmy corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus) or [otocinclus](/en/macrotocinclus-affinis).

Keeping them with other Apistogramma species in small tanks is not recommended — territorial conflicts between males are
inevitable. In a spacious tank (100 liters or more), cohabitation with
[Apistogramma borellii](/en/apistogramma-borellii) may work with sufficient hiding spots.

Avoid large, active, or aggressive fish — they suppress the cichlids and provoke chronic stress, leading to color loss
and weakened immunity.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma viejita_ is achievable in a home aquarium with the right conditions. They are cave spawners: the
female deposits 50–80 eggs on the ceiling of a shelter — a ceramic cave, coconut shell, or narrow crevice under
driftwood.

To trigger spawning, provide soft, acidic water (GH 1–5, pH 5.5–6.5) and slightly lower the temperature by 1–2 °C during
a water change. Generous live food offerings will further encourage breeding.

After spawning, the female takes complete charge of the clutch, developing an intense yellow coloration. The male
defends the outer boundaries of the territory. Eggs hatch in 2–3 days, and fry become free-swimming after 5–7 days.

First foods for the fry include baby brine shrimp (artemia nauplii) and microworms. The female zealously tends to her
brood for several weeks, guiding and protecting the school of fry. During this period, avoid any disturbances — do not
frighten the family group or introduce new fish.
