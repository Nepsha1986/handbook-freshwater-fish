## Overview

Polypterus bichir, commonly known as the Nile Bichir, is a large, elongated fish species native to the Nile River and
other freshwater habitats across Africa. Belonging to the family Polypteridae, this fascinating fish is recognized by
its distinct appearance, featuring a series of dorsal finlets and a snake-like body. Polypterus bichir can grow up to
60-75 cm in length and can live for 15-20 years in captivity. Its prehistoric look and nocturnal habits make it a
captivating addition to large, well-maintained aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Due to its size, Polypterus bichir requires a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 400 liters. The water temperature
should be kept between 24-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-20. A soft substrate like
sand or fine gravel is ideal, along with ample hiding spots such as caves, driftwood, and dense vegetation. The tank
must be securely covered, as Polypterus bichir is known for its ability to jump. Low lighting is recommended to
replicate its natural environment in murky waters.

## Feeding and Diet

Polypterus bichir is a carnivorous species that hunts smaller fish, crustaceans, and insects in the wild. In captivity,
it should be fed a varied diet of high-quality frozen or live foods, including bloodworms, shrimp, and small fish. It
can also be trained to accept sinking pellets formulated for carnivorous fish. Feeding is best done in the evening or at
night, aligning with the fish's natural nocturnal behavior. Ensure that food reaches the bottom of the tank, where
Polypterus bichir typically feeds.

## Care and Maintenance

Polypterus bichir is a hardy fish but requires specific care to thrive. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
crucial to maintaining water quality. Due to its ability to breathe atmospheric air, it must have easy access to the
water surface. The tank should be well-covered to prevent escapes, and water parameters should be closely monitored to
avoid drastic changes. Although Polypterus bichir is relatively resistant to diseases, maintaining a clean environment
and a balanced diet is essential for its health.

## Compatibility

Polypterus bichir is generally peaceful but should not be housed with very small fish, as it may consider them prey.
Suitable tank mates include other large, non-aggressive species such as larger catfish, cichlids, and larger characins.
It is best to avoid keeping it with fin-nipping species or very aggressive fish, as Polypterus bichir has delicate fins
that can be easily damaged. Tank mates should not be small enough to be eaten and should share similar water parameter
requirements.

## Breeding

Breeding Polypterus bichir in captivity is rare and challenging due to its specific breeding needs. In the wild,
Polypterus bichir spawns during the rainy season, laying eggs among dense vegetation. To replicate these conditions in
an aquarium, provide a large, heavily planted tank with a slightly lowered water level. Condition the fish with a diet
rich in live foods. If breeding is successful, the female will scatter eggs, which should be collected and transferred
to a separate breeding tank to prevent them from being eaten. The eggs will hatch within a few days, and the fry can be
fed infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp until they are large enough to accept larger foods.
