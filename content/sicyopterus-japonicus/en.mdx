## Overview

**Sicyopterus japonicus**, commonly referred to as the Japanese Freshwater Goby, is a vibrant and fascinating species
belonging to the Gobiidae family. Found in the fast-flowing streams and rivers of East Asia, particularly in Japan, this
species is recognized for its ability to cling to rocks and substrates in swift currents. Growing up to 10-15 cm (4-6
inches), Sicyopterus japonicus is noted for its vibrant coloration, with males displaying bright blue and red hues
during the breeding season. This species is relatively peaceful and well-suited for a riverine aquarium setup.

## Tank Requirements

The Japanese Freshwater Goby requires a tank of at least 100 liters (26 gallons) with plenty of water flow to mimic its
natural habitat. The water temperature should be maintained between 18-24°C (64-75°F), with a pH of 6.5-8.0 and general
hardness (GH) between 5-15. A well-aerated environment with rocks, pebbles, and smooth substrates is ideal to simulate
the riverine environment they are adapted to. These gobies are sensitive to water quality, so regular maintenance,
including frequent water changes and efficient filtration, is crucial.

## Feeding and Diet

Sicyopterus japonicus are primarily herbivores, feeding on algae and biofilm that grows on rocks and other substrates in
their natural habitat. In an aquarium, they will graze on algae but can also be supplemented with spirulina-based
flakes, algae wafers, and blanched vegetables like zucchini and spinach. Occasionally, they may accept small
invertebrates such as brine shrimp or daphnia, which can provide additional protein. A varied diet that mimics their
natural feeding habits is essential for their health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Sicyopterus japonicus requires attention to water quality and tank conditions due to their sensitivity to
environmental changes. They thrive in clean, oxygen-rich water with consistent water flow. Regular water changes (20-30%
weekly) are important to maintain water quality. Due to their specialized habitat requirements, they are not recommended
for beginner aquarists. Monitoring for any signs of stress or disease, such as changes in coloration or behavior, is
essential to ensure their well-being.

## Compatibility

Japanese Freshwater Gobies are generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish that thrive in
similar water conditions. Ideal tank mates include other gobies, hillstream loaches, and small barbs or rasboras. It's
best to avoid keeping them with large or aggressive species that may outcompete them for food or pose a threat.
Providing plenty of hiding spots and territories can help minimize stress and promote natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Sicyopterus japonicus in captivity is challenging due to their specific habitat needs and breeding behaviors.
In the wild, they migrate to downstream areas to spawn, where the eggs hatch into larvae that are carried out to sea
before returning upstream. Replicating these conditions in captivity is difficult. If attempting to breed, provide a
separate breeding tank with high water flow and mimic seasonal changes. Fry are extremely small and require specialized
care, including feeding on infusoria and other microscopic foods until they are large enough to accept standard fry
foods.
