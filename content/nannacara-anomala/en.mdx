## Overview

The Golden Dwarf Cichlid (_Nannacara anomala_) is a small and colorful cichlid species native to South America,
particularly in slow-moving rivers and creeks of Guyana and Suriname. Renowned for its brilliant golden coloration and
peaceful nature, it is a popular choice for community aquariums. This species thrives in well-maintained environments
and showcases unique behaviors, making it a delightful addition to aquarists of all levels.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 60 liters is recommended for the Golden Dwarf Cichlid. These fish prefer water temperatures
between 24-28Â°C, a pH range of 6.0-7.5, and moderate water hardness (GH 5-15). The tank should be well-planted with soft
substrate and hiding spots created by driftwood, rocks, or caves. Gentle water flow and regular maintenance are
essential for their well-being.

## Feeding and Diet

Golden Dwarf Cichlids are omnivorous, feeding on a mix of plant-based and protein-rich foods. In captivity, they can be
fed high-quality flake or pellet foods, supplemented with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, and
daphnia. A varied diet ensures vibrant coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and consistent monitoring of water parameters are crucial for maintaining the
health of this species. While they are hardy, poor water conditions can lead to stress and susceptibility to disease.
Ensure the tank remains clean and free from drastic fluctuations in temperature or pH.

## Compatibility

Golden Dwarf Cichlids are peaceful and can be housed with other non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include
small tetras, rasboras, and Corydoras catfish. Avoid pairing them with overly aggressive or territorial fish, as this
can lead to stress or injury.

## Breeding

Breeding _Nannacara anomala_ is relatively easy in a well-maintained aquarium. They are substrate spawners, with females
often selecting a flat surface or cave to lay their eggs. After spawning, the female becomes highly protective, caring
for the eggs and fry. Providing plenty of hiding spots will encourage successful breeding and fry survival.
