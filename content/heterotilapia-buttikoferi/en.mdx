## Overview

**Heterotilapia buttikoferi**, also known as the Zebra Tilapia or Buttikoferi Cichlid, is a large and robust freshwater
fish native to the rivers and lakes of West Africa. This species is notable for its bold black and white striped
pattern, which gives it a distinctive and striking appearance. Growing up to 30-35 cm (12-14 inches) in length, the
Zebra Tilapia is a popular choice for experienced aquarists who can provide the necessary space and care to accommodate
its size and temperament.

## Tank Requirements

The Zebra Tilapia requires a spacious aquarium of at least 300 liters (80 gallons) due to its large size and active
nature. The water temperature should be maintained between 22-28°C (72-82°F), with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and a general
hardness (GH) of 5-20. The tank should be equipped with a robust filtration system to handle the bioload of such a large
fish. A sandy substrate with plenty of hiding spots, such as rocks and driftwood, is recommended, as well as some hardy
plants that can tolerate their digging behavior.

## Feeding and Diet

Zebra Tilapias are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, consisting of plant material, invertebrates, and small
fish. In captivity, they should be fed a diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with fresh
vegetables, such as spinach or zucchini, and occasional live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, or
earthworms. Feeding should be done once or twice daily, ensuring not to overfeed, as they are prone to obesity.

## Care and Maintenance

The Zebra Tilapia is known for its aggressive and territorial behavior, especially as it matures. They require regular
tank maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-30% to maintain optimal water quality. It is essential to monitor
water parameters regularly and maintain a clean substrate to prevent the accumulation of waste. Providing ample space
and visual barriers in the tank can help reduce aggression and stress among tank mates.

## Compatibility

Due to their aggressive nature, Zebra Tilapias are best kept either alone or with other large, robust fish that can
withstand their territorial behavior. Suitable tank mates include other large cichlids, large catfish, or
semi-aggressive fish that occupy different levels of the aquarium. It is important to avoid keeping them with smaller,
more passive species, as they may become targets of aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Zebra Tilapias in captivity can be challenging due to their aggressive nature and specific water requirements.
They are known to be substrate spawners, often choosing flat surfaces such as rocks or aquarium glass for egg-laying. To
encourage breeding, it is advisable to maintain stable water conditions with a slightly higher temperature (around
26-28°C). The parents will guard the eggs and fry fiercely, so providing ample hiding spots for other tank mates is
crucial to prevent conflicts. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed with finely crushed flake food or
specialized fry food.
