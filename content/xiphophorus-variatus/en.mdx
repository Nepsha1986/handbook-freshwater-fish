## Overview

**Xiphophorus variatus**, commonly known as the Platy or Variable Platy, is a small and colorful freshwater fish native
to Central America, particularly in Mexico and parts of the United States. These fish are popular among aquarists due to
their hardiness, vibrant colors, and peaceful nature, making them an excellent choice for community tanks.

Platies typically grow to a size of 4 to 6 cm and are available in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid,
spotted, and marbled variations. They are livebearers, meaning they give birth to live young instead of laying eggs.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 80 liters is recommended for a small group of **Xiphophorus variatus**. They thrive in water
temperatures ranging from 20 to 26°C. The general hardness (GH) should be kept between 10-30 dGH, and the pH level
should be maintained between 7.0 and 8.0.

To create a suitable environment, provide plenty of plants, hiding spots, and open swimming areas. Platies appreciate a
well-planted aquarium with subdued lighting, which helps them feel secure.

## Feeding and Diet

**Xiphophorus variatus** are omnivores and will thrive on a balanced diet. In captivity, they should be fed high-quality
flakes or pellets designed for community fish, along with occasional live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia,
and bloodworms.

A varied diet will help maintain their color and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Platies are relatively easy to care for and adapt well to a variety of water conditions. Regular water changes and good
filtration are essential to keep the tank clean and healthy. They are sensitive to poor water quality, so monitoring
ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels is crucial.

These fish are social and do best when kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals. However, be cautious about
male-to-female ratios, as males can sometimes become aggressive during breeding.

## Compatibility

**Xiphophorus variatus** are generally peaceful and can be kept with a variety of tank mates. Suitable companions
include other livebearers, tetras, rasboras, and smaller cichlids. Avoid aggressive species or larger fish that may see
them as food.

Due to their social nature, it’s best to keep them in groups to reduce stress and encourage natural behaviors.

## Breeding

Breeding **Xiphophorus variatus** is relatively easy, making them popular among hobbyists. Males display colorful
patterns and exhibit courtship behavior to attract females. Once a female is ready to spawn, she will give birth to live
fry, which can occur every 28-30 days.

To ensure the survival of fry, provide plenty of hiding spots in the tank. It is often helpful to separate pregnant
females into a breeding tank to prevent them from eating their young.
