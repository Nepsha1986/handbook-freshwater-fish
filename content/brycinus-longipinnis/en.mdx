## Overview

Brycinus longipinnis, commonly referred to as the African Long-finned Tetra, is a visually appealing species known for
its elongated, flowing fins and silver body. Native to the slow-moving rivers and streams of West Africa, these fish are
known for their peaceful temperament and are suitable for community aquariums. They can grow up to 12-15 cm in length
and are best kept in groups to showcase their natural schooling behavior.

## Tank Requirements

African Long-finned Tetras require a spacious tank of at least 120 liters to accommodate their active swimming habits.
The ideal water temperature for this species ranges from 22-28°C, with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness between 5-15
dGH. A well-planted tank with ample open areas for swimming, along with a gentle water flow, mimics their natural
habitat. The addition of some driftwood and leaf litter can also create a more authentic environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Brycinus longipinnis are omnivorous, feeding on small insects, crustaceans, and plant
material. In captivity, they should be offered a varied diet that includes high-quality flake or pellet food,
supplemented with live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Feeding them 2-3 times daily in small
portions will keep them healthy and vibrant.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular tank maintenance is crucial for the health of African Long-finned Tetras. Perform weekly water changes of about
25-30% to ensure optimal water quality. Monitoring water parameters and ensuring a clean environment will help prevent
common health issues. These tetras are generally hardy but may be susceptible to stress-related diseases if kept in
suboptimal conditions.

## Compatibility

Brycinus longipinnis is a peaceful species that gets along well with other non-aggressive fish. They are ideal tank
mates for other medium to large tetras, barbs, and peaceful cichlids. However, due to their size and active nature, they
should not be kept with very small or slow-moving species. Keeping them in groups of five or more will promote their
natural schooling behavior and reduce stress.

## Breeding

Breeding African Long-finned Tetras in captivity can be challenging but is achievable under the right conditions. A
separate breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.0-6.5) and a temperature of 26-28°C is recommended.
Provide fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop for the eggs. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating
the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or commercially prepared fry food
until they are large enough to accept finely crushed flake food.
