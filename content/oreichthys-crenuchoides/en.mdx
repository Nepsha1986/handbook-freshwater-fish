## Overview

**Oreichthys crenuchoides**, commonly known as the Drape Fin Barb, is a peaceful, small species from the Cyprinidae
family. Originating from Southeast Asia, these fish are admired for their unique fin structure, where the males display
a distinct "drape" appearance on their dorsal fins. These barbs make a great addition to planted aquariums due to their
gentle nature and striking appearance.

## Tank Requirements

Drape Fin Barbs are best housed in an aquarium with a minimum capacity of 60 liters (16 gallons). The ideal temperature
range is between 22-26°C (72-79°F), with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-12. These fish prefer a
well-planted environment with plenty of hiding spaces and subdued lighting to mimic their natural habitat. They also
appreciate areas with gentle water flow.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, **Oreichthys crenuchoides** feed on small invertebrates and organic matter. In captivity, they
will readily accept a variety of foods including high-quality micro pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as
daphnia, baby brine shrimp, and bloodworms. Supplementing their diet with plant-based foods will also help maintain
their vibrant coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Drape Fin Barbs are relatively easy to care for, but they do require stable water conditions. Regular water changes of
around 20-30% every week are recommended to keep the water clean and stable. They should be kept in groups of at least
six, as they are schooling fish and will exhibit more natural behavior in larger groups.

## Compatibility

These barbs are peaceful and can be kept with a variety of small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras, rasboras, and
dwarf cichlids. They should not be housed with large or aggressive species that may bully or outcompete them for food.
Their calm demeanor and unique appearance make them an excellent addition to community aquariums.

## Breeding

Breeding **Oreichthys crenuchoides** in home aquariums is possible with the right setup. These fish are egg scatterers,
and breeding typically occurs in a well-planted tank with soft water. Once spawning occurs, it's best to remove the
adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or
finely crushed flake food once they become free-swimming.
