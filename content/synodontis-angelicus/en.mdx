## Overview

**Synodontis angelicus**, commonly known as the Angelic Synodontis, is a strikingly beautiful catfish species from the
family Mochokidae. Native to Lake Tanganyika in Africa, this species is admired for its unique appearance and peaceful
demeanor. Synodontis angelicus can grow up to 25-30 cm (10-12 inches) and has a lifespan of 10-15 years in captivity.
Its nocturnal nature means it is most active during the night, often hiding during the day. With its attractive
coloration and generally calm temperament, it is a popular choice for well-planned community tanks that mimic its
natural environment.

## Tank Requirements

Synodontis angelicus requires a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 200 liters (50 gallons). The water
temperature should be maintained between 24-28°C (75-82°F), with a pH range of 7.0-8.5 and a general hardness (GH) of
10-20. The tank should replicate their natural rocky habitat, providing plenty of hiding spots and crevices using rocks
and caves. This helps to reduce stress and allow the fish to exhibit natural behaviors. Keeping them in a group of at
least 3-5 individuals is recommended to ensure they feel secure and can socialize properly.

## Feeding and Diet

Synodontis angelicus is omnivorous and thrives on a varied diet. In the wild, their diet consists of a mix of small
invertebrates, algae, and detritus. In the aquarium, they should be fed a balanced diet including high-quality sinking
pellets or wafers, as well as live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Supplementing their diet
with occasional vegetable matter, such as spirulina-based foods or blanched spinach, can help maintain their health and
coloration. Feeding should be done in the evening or at night to align with their nocturnal habits.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Synodontis angelicus involves regular maintenance to ensure their well-being. Weekly water changes of 20-30%
are necessary to keep the water clean and stable. The tank should be kept clean, with regular removal of detritus and
maintenance of filtration systems. Synodontis angelicus is a hardy species, but it is important to monitor water
parameters closely and avoid abrupt changes. They are generally healthy and resistant to many common fish diseases, but
maintaining a stable environment is key to their overall health.

## Compatibility

Synodontis angelicus is well-suited for community tanks with other peaceful species, especially those from Lake
Tanganyika. They get along well with cichlids from the same region, such as Julidochromis and Neolamprologus species, as
well as other robust fish that can tolerate similar water conditions. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive or
highly territorial fish, which could stress or harm them. They can be kept with other Synodontis species, provided there
is enough space and hiding spots for all tank inhabitants.

## Breeding

Breeding Synodontis angelicus in captivity is moderately challenging. They are egg scatterers and prefer to spawn in
caves or crevices. To encourage breeding, provide a stable tank environment with plenty of hiding places and ensure that
the fish are well-fed. Condition the breeding pair with a high-protein diet and create a separate breeding tank if
possible to protect the eggs and fry. The eggs will typically hatch in about 3-5 days, and the fry should be fed
infusoria or finely crushed food until they are large enough for regular feedings. Breeding success may vary, so
patience and careful monitoring are essential.
