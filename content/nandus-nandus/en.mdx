## Overview

**Nandus nandus**, commonly referred to as the **Gangetic Leaf Fish** or simply **Nandus**, is a fascinating species
known for its leaf-like appearance and remarkable camouflage abilities. Native to rivers, ponds, and other slow-moving
freshwater habitats in South Asia, this fish grows between 10-15 cm and can live for 5-8 years in captivity. Its cryptic
coloration helps it blend seamlessly into plant debris and leaves, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting prey.

## Tank Requirements

The **Gangetic Leaf Fish** requires a tank size of at least 100 liters, with water temperatures ranging from 22-28Â°C, a
pH level between 6.5-8.0, and water hardness (GH) between 8-18. This species thrives in well-planted tanks with subdued
lighting to replicate its natural habitat. Provide plenty of hiding spots using driftwood, rocks, and dense vegetation.
A gentle water flow is ideal for their comfort, as they come from calm waters.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Nandus nandus** is a carnivorous ambush predator that feeds on smaller fish and invertebrates. In
captivity, it should be fed a diet of live or frozen food such as bloodworms, small fish, and shrimp. They might refuse
dry foods, so offering live or frozen options is crucial to their well-being. Their predatory nature means that they
might hunt smaller tank mates, so feeding should be done regularly to curb this behavior.

## Care and Maintenance

Due to its preference for clean water and specific tank conditions, the **Gangetic Leaf Fish** requires regular
maintenance. Perform weekly water changes of about 25-30% and ensure the water parameters remain stable. Keep an eye on
ammonia and nitrite levels, as these fish are sensitive to poor water quality. Given their shy and ambush nature,
minimizing stress is important, so provide enough cover and hiding spots.

## Compatibility

**Nandus nandus** can be somewhat territorial and aggressive, especially toward smaller fish that may be viewed as prey.
It is best housed with larger, peaceful species that won't fit into their mouths. Tank mates like larger barbs, peaceful
cichlids, or catfish can be suitable companions. Avoid housing them with very small or overly active species, as they
may stress out the **Gangetic Leaf Fish**.

## Breeding

Breeding **Nandus nandus** in captivity can be challenging due to their territorial nature and specific breeding
conditions. They are known to be egg layers, and spawning is usually triggered by changes in water temperature and the
introduction of a suitable breeding environment. Males will become more aggressive and protective during the breeding
season. Once eggs are laid, they should be removed to avoid being eaten by adults. The fry require tiny live foods like
brine shrimp to survive.
