## Overview

**Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus**, also known as the **Flying Fox**, is a highly active and sleek fish commonly found in
fast-moving streams and rivers in Southeast Asia. Growing to around 12-15 cm, it is recognized for its role in
controlling algae in aquariums. Its body is streamlined with a striking black horizontal stripe running from the nose to
the tail, bordered by gold and brown.

## Tank Requirements

The Flying Fox thrives in a tank of at least 120 liters, with water temperatures between 24-28°C. The ideal pH range is
6.0-7.5, and the general hardness (GH) should be between 5-12. It prefers a well-oxygenated tank with moderate water
flow and plenty of hiding spots, such as rocks and driftwood, to mimic its natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus** grazes on algae, plant matter, and small invertebrates. In an aquarium, it
should be provided with a balanced diet that includes algae wafers, spirulina-based foods, and occasional live or frozen
foods like bloodworms and daphnia. Providing a varied diet helps maintain its vibrant colors and energy.

## Care and Maintenance

The Flying Fox is relatively hardy, but it requires clean water to stay healthy. Weekly water changes of 20-30% are
recommended. Regularly monitor the water quality, as poor conditions can lead to health issues. Ensuring proper
filtration and water flow is essential for the well-being of this species, as it prefers well-oxygenated water.

## Compatibility

While generally peaceful, the Flying Fox can become territorial with other similar-shaped fish, especially as it
matures. It is best kept with fast-moving, non-aggressive species such as tetras, barbs, and rasboras. Avoid housing it
with slow or long-finned species, as it may harass them. It is also important to provide plenty of hiding spaces to
minimize territorial aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding **Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus** in captivity is considered very difficult. Little is known about their breeding
habits in aquariums, and most Flying Foxes available in the trade are wild-caught. If breeding is attempted, a large
tank with slightly warmer water (26-28°C) and soft, acidic water may be needed to simulate breeding conditions, though
success rates are typically low.
