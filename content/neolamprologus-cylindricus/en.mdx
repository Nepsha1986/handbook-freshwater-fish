## Overview

**Neolamprologus cylindricus**, commonly referred to as the Cylindricus Cichlid, is a visually stunning species from
Lake Tanganyika. Its elongated, cylindrical body and bold black-and-white stripes make it a popular choice for aquarists
who appreciate Tanganyikan cichlids.

## Tank Requirements

Neolamprologus cylindricus requires a tank of at least 100 liters to accommodate its active and territorial nature. A
rocky aquascape with numerous hiding spots mimics its natural habitat. Keep the water temperature between 24-28Â°C, pH
between 7.8-9.0, and hardness levels of 10-20 dGH.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, these fish are carnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates and zooplankton. In captivity, they thrive on
high-quality cichlid pellets, frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and mysis shrimp.

## Care and Maintenance

Cylindricus Cichlids are moderately challenging to care for due to their specific water requirements and territorial
tendencies. Regular water changes and strong filtration are necessary to maintain water quality. Provide plenty of rocks
and caves to establish territories and reduce aggression.

## Compatibility

These fish are highly territorial and best suited to species-only tanks or setups with other Tanganyikan cichlids of
similar size and temperament. Avoid keeping them with smaller, less aggressive fish to prevent bullying.

## Breeding

Breeding Neolamprologus cylindricus is achievable in home aquariums. They are cave spawners, with females laying eggs in
secluded spaces. The male fertilizes the eggs and guards the territory while the female tends to the eggs and fry.
Provide plenty of hiding spots to encourage spawning, and feed the fry with baby brine shrimp or finely crushed flakes.
