## Overview

Botia Kubotai (_Botia kubotai_) is a small but very colorful fish from the Botiidae family, native to the rivers of
Myanmar and Thailand. Adults reach a length of about 10–12 cm and are known for their unique marbled pattern, resembling
zebra stripes or marble swirls. This fish prefers to live in groups and requires an aquarium with plenty of hiding
spots. Botia Kubotai is suitable for experienced aquarists, as it requires stable conditions and careful maintenance.

The main feature of Botia Kubotai is its bright coloration: the body is covered with alternating light and dark stripes,
creating a striking marbled pattern. This species is also known for its activity and curiosity, making it interesting to
observe. Botia Kubotai are schooling fish, and they should be kept in groups of 5–6 individuals to ensure their comfort.

### What Makes This Species Unique

- **Marbled Pattern**: The unique coloration, resembling zebra stripes or marble, makes this fish one of the most
  beautiful in its family.
- **Active Nature**: Botia Kubotai love to explore the aquarium and often play with each other, making their behavior
  fascinating to watch.
- **Ability to Produce Sounds**: Like other loaches, this species can produce quiet "clicking" sounds, especially during
  interactions or in stressful situations.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females

Distinguishing males from females in Botia Kubotai is quite difficult, as sexual dimorphism is not pronounced. However,
there are a few signs:

**Main differences**:

- Females are usually larger and have a rounder belly, especially during the spawning period.
- Males are slimmer and may be slightly more brightly colored.
- Males are more active in hierarchical games.

These signs will help you distinguish the sexes, but accurate determination requires experience and careful observation.

## Care and Maintenance

Botia Kubotai requires stable conditions and careful maintenance. The aquarium should have a volume of at least 100
liters, as the fish prefer to live in groups and need space to swim. Water parameters should be as follows: temperature
24–28°C, pH 6.0–7.5, hardness 5–12 dGH. Regular water changes (20–25% of the volume weekly) will help maintain
cleanliness.

For comfortable keeping of Botia Kubotai, the following are necessary:

- **Filtration and Aeration**: The fish are sensitive to water quality, so a powerful filter and good aeration are
  essential.
- **Substrate**: Use soft sand or fine gravel to avoid damaging their sensitive barbels.
- **Hiding Spots**: Driftwood, rocks, and caves are necessary to create a comfortable environment.

Botia Kubotai are peaceful but may display territorial behavior within their group. They get along well with other
non-aggressive species, such as tetras, rasboras, and Corydoras.

## Diet and Nutrition

Botia Kubotai is an omnivorous fish. In the wild, it feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant matter. In
the aquarium, the diet should be varied:

- **Live and Frozen Foods**: Bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia.
- **Dry Foods**: High-quality pellets and flakes for bottom-dwelling fish.
- **Plant-Based Foods**: Blanched vegetables (cucumber, zucchini) and foods with plant components.

Feed 1–2 times a day in small portions. A fasting day can be arranged once a week.

## Compatibility with Other Species

Botia Kubotai is a peaceful fish that gets along well with other non-aggressive species. Ideal tankmates include:

- Tetras
- Rasboras
- Corydoras
- Gouramis

Avoid keeping them with large and aggressive fish, such as cichlids. Also, be cautious with small shrimp, as Botias may
perceive them as prey.

## Breeding in the Aquarium

Breeding Botia Kubotai in a home aquarium is extremely difficult. In the wild, they spawn in rivers with fast currents,
which is hard to replicate in an aquarium. To stimulate spawning, the following are required:

- A separate spawning tank.
- Soft water (hardness up to 6 dGH) with a temperature of 26–28°C.
- Strong current and dim lighting.

After spawning, the parents should be removed, as they may eat the eggs. The fry hatch within 24–48 hours and begin
swimming after 3–4 days. Feed them infusoria and brine shrimp nauplii.
