## Overview

The Kubotai Loach (_Botia kubotai_), also known as the Polka Dot Loach or Marbled Loach, is a small, peaceful loach
species known for its beautiful, spotted pattern. Originating from freshwater streams in Myanmar and Thailand, this
loach is popular among aquarists due to its friendly nature and striking appearance. It does well in groups and enjoys a
well-decorated tank with plenty of hiding spots.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 100 liters is recommended for Kubotai Loaches, with water temperatures between 24-28°C, pH levels of
6.0-7.5, and GH of 5-12. They prefer a sandy or fine gravel substrate with ample hiding places such as caves, driftwood,
and rocks. A gentle water flow is also appreciated, mimicking their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Kubotai Loaches are omnivorous and enjoy a varied diet. They will readily accept sinking pellets, flake foods, and
occasional live or frozen treats such as bloodworms and brine shrimp. Supplementing with vegetable-based foods, like
blanched spinach or cucumber, helps ensure balanced nutrition.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is relatively easy to care for as long as water quality is maintained through regular water changes (20-25%
weekly) and proper filtration. Kubotai Loaches are sensitive to poor water conditions, so it’s essential to keep their
environment clean and stable. Regular monitoring for health issues is recommended.

## Compatibility

Kubotai Loaches are peaceful and social, making them ideal for community tanks. They enjoy the company of their own
species, so keeping them in groups of at least 5 is recommended. They are compatible with other peaceful fish like
tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid housing them with aggressive or overly territorial species.

## Breeding

Breeding Kubotai Loaches in captivity is rare and challenging, as specific environmental conditions and cues are
required. Little is known about their breeding habits in home aquariums. Most specimens available are wild-caught or
imported, and successful breeding attempts are generally limited to professional breeding facilities.
