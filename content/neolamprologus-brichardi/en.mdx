## Overview

The Fairy Cichlid (_Neolamprologus brichardi_), also known as the Princess of Burundi, is a captivating species from
Lake Tanganyika in Africa. It features a slender body, soft beige or gray coloring, and elongated fins with elegant
trailing edges. Its unique family-oriented behavior and stunning appearance make it a favorite in the cichlid hobbyist
community.

## Tank Requirements

For optimal care, Fairy Cichlids require a tank of at least 100 liters with a temperature between 24-26Â°C. The water
should have a pH of 7.8-9.0 and a hardness level (GH) of 10-20. They thrive in aquariums with plenty of rock formations
and caves that allow them to establish territories and hide. Sandy substrate and stable water conditions are ideal.

## Feeding and Diet

Fairy Cichlids are omnivores that thrive on a mix of high-quality pellets, flakes, and occasional live or frozen foods
like brine shrimp and daphnia. Providing a varied diet is important for their health and coloration. Feed them two to
three times daily in small portions.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential for Fairy Cichlids, as they prefer stable water parameters. Perform 20-25% weekly water
changes to maintain quality. Monitor water conditions closely, as they are sensitive to rapid changes in their
environment.

## Compatibility

Fairy Cichlids are semi-aggressive, especially when breeding, but generally peaceful in well-managed community setups.
They are best kept with other small Lake Tanganyika species or non-aggressive fish. They are social within their family
units and will protect their young, making them suitable for group setups.

## Breeding

Fairy Cichlids are prolific breeders, especially when provided with caves or rock crevices to spawn. The parents exhibit
strong parental care, protecting the eggs and fry until they are self-sufficient. This makes them an ideal choice for
hobbyists interested in observing natural family behaviors.
