## Overview

_Balantiocheilos melanopterus_, known as the Bala Shark or Silver Shark, is one of the most impressive freshwater fish
for the home aquarium. Despite its common name, it is not a true shark but belongs to the carp family (Cyprinidae). This
species originates from rivers and lakes of Southeast Asia: Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. In the wild, the
species is endangered due to habitat destruction.

The body is sleek and torpedo-shaped, silver in color with distinctive black edging on the dorsal, caudal, anal, and
pelvic fins. Adults reach 35–40 cm and live 8–10 years. This is a schooling, highly active, and skittish fish that can
build up significant speed when startled and leap out of the water. Pet stores sell juveniles at 5–7 cm, and beginner
aquarists often underestimate how large this fish will grow.

## Tank Requirements

The Bala Shark needs a spacious aquarium of at least 500 liters. Tank length is critical — a minimum of 150 cm so the
fish can swim freely at speed. Optimal water parameters: temperature 22–28°C, pH 6.5–7.5, hardness GH 5–15. Powerful
filtration with moderate current is essential — this simulates river conditions and keeps the fish active.

The aquarium must have a tight-fitting lid — Bala Sharks are notorious jumpers, especially when stressed or startled.
Keep the decor minimal: sand or fine gravel substrate, a few large rocks and driftwood for shelter, but leave most of
the volume open for swimming. Live plants are acceptable, but choose large, robust species — delicate plants will be
damaged by these active fish.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Balantiocheilos melanopterus_ is an omnivore feeding on insects, larvae, small crustaceans, and plant
matter. In the aquarium, high-quality pellets or flakes for large fish should form the staple diet. Supplement with
frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.

The vegetable component is important — offer blanched spinach, lettuce leaves, scalded peas, or spirulina-based foods.
Feed twice daily in portions consumed within 3–5 minutes. Keep in mind that large adults consume considerable amounts of
food, which should be factored into the cost of keeping them.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25–30% are essential for the health of these large, active fish. Powerful filtration is a must —
the biological load from a school of large fish is substantial. Test water parameters regularly: ammonia and nitrites at
zero, nitrates below 25 mg/l.

Bala Sharks are sensitive to stress. Sudden movements near the tank, loud noises, or abrupt light changes can trigger
panic and injuries from colliding with the glass. Place the aquarium in a calm location and use gradual lighting
transitions. When performing maintenance, move slowly and avoid sudden gestures. Check the lid regularly — even a small
gap can become an escape route.

## Compatibility

The Bala Shark is a peaceful schooling fish that must be kept in groups of at least 3–5 individuals. When kept alone or
in pairs, the fish becomes highly stressed, skittish, and may display uncharacteristic aggression. Good tankmates
include other large peaceful species: [Tinfoil Barb](/en/barbonymus-schwanenfeldii),
[Clown Loach](/en/chromobotia-macracanthus), large [gouramis](/en/trichopodus-leerii), and medium-sized peaceful
cichlids.

Avoid keeping with small fish — tetras, rasboras, and small barbs may be seen as food by adult Bala Sharks. Also avoid
aggressive or territorial species that will stress the timid Bala Shark.

## Breeding

Breeding _Balantiocheilos melanopterus_ in aquariums is extremely difficult (difficulty 5 out of 5) and virtually
impossible in home setups. In the wild, spawning occurs in large rivers during the rainy season when fish undertake
migrations. Replicating these conditions would require a tank of several thousand liters with precise simulation of
seasonal changes.

The Bala Shark is an egg scatterer, releasing eggs into the water column. Commercial breeding takes place on large farms
in Southeast Asia using hormonal stimulation. Virtually all fish sold in pet stores are farm-bred. If you are
specifically interested in breeding fish, consider more accessible cyprinid species instead.
