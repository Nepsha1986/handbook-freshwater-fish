## Overview

Danio choprae, commonly known as the Glowlight Danio, is a striking freshwater fish native to Myanmar. This species is
prized for its vivid orange and yellow stripes, which glow under proper lighting conditions. It is a small, active
species well-suited to peaceful community aquariums, making it a favorite among aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Danio choprae thrives in tanks of at least 50 liters, with a water temperature between 22-28Â°C. They prefer slightly
acidic to neutral water, with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and a general hardness (dGH) of 5-12. The tank should have plants,
driftwood, and plenty of open space for swimming, as these fish are energetic swimmers. Moderate water flow replicates
their natural riverine habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Danio choprae primarily feed on insects and plankton. In captivity, they are omnivorous and can be fed
high-quality flakes, micro pellets, and live or frozen food such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. A varied diet
enhances their coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio choprae is relatively easy to care for, making it a good choice for both beginner and experienced aquarists.
Regular water changes and monitoring of water quality are essential. These fish are sensitive to poor water conditions,
so keeping their environment clean is important for their long-term health.

## Compatibility

Danio choprae is a peaceful species that does well with other non-aggressive tank mates. Suitable companions include
small tetras, rasboras, and other danios. It is best to keep them in groups of at least 6 individuals, as they are
social fish and will display more natural behaviors when kept in a shoal.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio choprae in captivity is possible with the right conditions. They are egg scatterers, and a separate
breeding tank with fine-leaved plants is recommended. After spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent them from
eating the eggs. The eggs hatch within 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or liquid fry food.
