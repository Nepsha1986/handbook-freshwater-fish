## Overview

**Nandopsis tetracanthus**, commonly known as the Cuban Cichlid, is a robust freshwater species native to the coastal
waters of Cuba and the nearby islands. This cichlid is recognized for its striking appearance, featuring a deep,
laterally compressed body and vibrant coloration that can vary among individuals.

Reaching a size of 20 to 30 cm, Cuban Cichlids can live for 10 to 15 years in captivity when provided with optimal care.
They exhibit a territorial nature, particularly during breeding, which makes them a captivating but sometimes
challenging species for aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 200 liters is recommended for **Nandopsis tetracanthus** to ensure ample swimming space and
territory establishment. The ideal temperature range is between 24 and 28°C, with a general hardness (GH) of 10-20 dGH
and a pH level of 6.5 to 8.0.

Cuban Cichlids prefer a well-decorated tank with hiding spots created by rocks, caves, and dense vegetation. This setup
will help reduce stress and allow them to exhibit natural behaviors.

## Feeding and Diet

**Nandopsis tetracanthus** are omnivores and require a varied diet to thrive. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality
pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods, including bloodworms, brine shrimp, and vegetable matter.

A well-rounded diet is essential for their health, coloration, and growth. It’s recommended to feed them once or twice a
day, ensuring that all food is consumed within a few minutes to maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Cuban Cichlids require regular maintenance to keep their environment healthy. Weekly water changes of 25-30% are
advisable to maintain good water quality and reduce waste accumulation. Monitoring ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels
is crucial to prevent stress and illness.

They can exhibit territorial behavior, especially during breeding, so it’s important to provide plenty of hiding places
and space to establish territories. Keeping them with compatible species will help reduce aggression.

## Compatibility

**Nandopsis tetracanthus** can be kept with other medium to large cichlids and robust fish that can tolerate their
territorial nature. Avoid keeping them with smaller or more timid species, as they may become targets of aggression.

When introducing new tank mates, it’s advisable to do so gradually and monitor interactions closely to ensure a peaceful
environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Nandopsis tetracanthus** can be rewarding but requires proper conditions. They form monogamous pairs and
typically lay their eggs on flat surfaces, such as rocks or broad leaves. After the eggs hatch, both parents will guard
and care for the fry.

Providing a separate breeding tank can enhance the chances of successful breeding and reduce stress from other tank
inhabitants. Regular water changes and maintaining optimal conditions will encourage breeding behavior.
