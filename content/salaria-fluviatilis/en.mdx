## Overview

The River Blenny (Salaria fluviatilis) is a distinctive freshwater fish native to rivers and streams in Europe. Known
for its unique appearance and behavior, this fish can grow to 10-15 cm in length. Its body is elongated and covered with
small, smooth scales, and it often displays a variety of colors, including shades of green, brown, and yellow. River
Blennies are well-suited for aquariums with plenty of hiding spots and a well-planted setup.

## Tank Requirements

River Blennies require a spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. The ideal water temperature should be
between 18-22°C, with a pH level ranging from 7.0 to 8.0 and water hardness (GH) between 10-20. They prefer a tank with
plenty of hiding spots, such as rocks and driftwood, and a well-planted environment that mimics their natural habitat.
Gentle filtration and regular water changes are important to maintain water quality and ensure the fish’s health.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, River Blennies feed on small invertebrates, algae, and detritus. In captivity, they should be provided with
a varied diet that includes high-quality pellets or flakes, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp,
and algae-based foods. Their diet should be rich in protein and fiber to support their health and vibrant colors. Feed
them 1-2 times a day, and avoid overfeeding to maintain good water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care and maintenance are crucial for the health of River Blennies. Perform weekly water changes of 20-25% to
keep the water clean and free of pollutants. Ensure the tank environment is well-structured with plenty of hiding spots
and a suitable substrate. Monitor the fish for signs of stress or disease and address any issues promptly. Regular
observation will help ensure the fish remains healthy and active.

## Compatibility

River Blennies are relatively peaceful but can be territorial, especially towards their own kind. They are best kept
with other calm and non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include small community fish like tetras and rasboras.
Avoid keeping them with more aggressive or larger species that might bully or harm them. Providing a well-structured
tank with ample hiding spots will help reduce territorial disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding River Blennies in captivity can be challenging. They are egg-layers and typically require specific conditions
to stimulate spawning. Maintain a slightly higher water temperature around 20-22°C and provide a well-planted tank with
plenty of hiding spots. The fish will lay their eggs in hidden areas, and the fry will need to be fed with infusoria or
finely crushed food once they become free-swimming. Monitoring and maintaining the breeding environment is crucial for
successful reproduction.
