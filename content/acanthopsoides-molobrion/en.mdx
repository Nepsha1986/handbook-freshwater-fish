## Overview

The Dwarf Horseface Loach, _Acanthopsoides molobrion_, is a fascinating and diminutive member of the Cobitidae family,
native to the slow-moving, blackwater rivers and streams of Southeast Asia. Reaching a maximum size of only 2 inches (5
cm), this slender loach is distinguished by its elongated, horse-like snout and a variable pattern of dark blotches
along its body. It is a shy, nocturnal creature that spends most of the day buried in the substrate with only its eyes
protruding, coming out at night to forage for food.

## Tank Requirements

A biotope-style setup is ideal for the Dwarf Horseface Loach. A minimum tank size of 10 gallons (40 liters) is suitable
for a small group, but a larger footprint is always better to provide ample foraging area. The most critical component
of their habitat is the substrate, which must be a deep layer of fine, soft sand to allow for their natural burrowing
behavior without causing injury to their delicate barbels and skin.

Water parameters should be stable, with a temperature between 72-79°F (22-26°C), a pH of 5.5-6.5, and soft water with a
hardness of 1-5 dGH. Filtration should be gentle, and the lighting subdued, with plenty of cover provided by driftwood,
caves, and leaf litter (such as Indian almond leaves) to create a sense of security.

## Feeding and Diet

Dwarf Horseface Loaches are micropredators, sifting through the substrate for tiny crustaceans, insect larvae, and other
invertebrates. In the aquarium, they require a diet of small, high-quality sinking foods. Live and frozen options like
daphnia, cyclops, and baby brine shrimp are excellent choices. Crushed flake foods and micropellets will also be
accepted. It is essential to feed in the evening or after lights-out to ensure these nocturnal feeders get their share.

## Care and Maintenance

These loaches are peaceful and social, and should be kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals to encourage their
natural behaviors and reduce shyness. They are sensitive to poor water quality, so regular partial water changes are a
must. Due to their burrowing nature, they can be difficult to observe, so it's important to ensure they are actively
feeding and not being outcompeted for food by more boisterous tankmates.

## Compatibility

The Dwarf Horseface Loach is an ideal inhabitant for a peaceful community aquarium with other small, gentle species that
occupy the upper levels of the water column. Good tankmates include small rasboras like
[Boraras brigittae](/en/boraras-brigittae) or [Trigonostigma espei](/en/trigonostigma-espei), and celestial pearl danios
([Danio margaritatus](/en/danio-margaritatus)). Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive fish, or with other
boisterous bottom-dwellers that might intimidate them or compete for food.

## Breeding

Breeding the Dwarf Horseface Loach in the home aquarium is considered very difficult and is not a common occurrence.
They are egg-scatterers, and there are no reliable reports of successful captive breeding. A dedicated breeding setup
with very soft, acidic water and a mature, well-established environment would likely be required to trigger spawning
behavior.
