## Overview

Garra flavatra, commonly referred to as the Panda Garra, is a freshwater fish native to Myanmar. It is well known for
its distinctive black and yellow banding and its role as an algae eater in aquariums. These fish are active, peaceful,
and excellent at controlling algae in planted tanks. They thrive in fast-moving water, mimicking their natural river
habitats.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 100 liters is recommended for Garra flavatra. The water temperature should be maintained between
22-26Â°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of 5-12 dGH. They prefer strong water flow and will benefit
from a tank setup that includes rocks and driftwood to mimic their natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

Garra flavatra primarily feeds on algae in the wild. In captivity, they can be fed algae wafers, blanched vegetables,
and small amounts of protein-based foods like bloodworms. Their diet should be supplemented to ensure they remain
healthy and vibrant in the aquarium.

## Care and Maintenance

These fish are relatively easy to care for and thrive with regular maintenance. Weekly water changes, maintaining good
water flow, and cleaning the tank are essential to keep the Panda Garra healthy. Regular monitoring of water parameters
will also ensure a stable environment for this hardy species.

## Compatibility

Garra flavatra is a peaceful species, making it an excellent choice for community tanks. They do well with other
non-aggressive species. However, they can sometimes exhibit minor territorial behaviors, especially toward other bottom
dwellers, so providing enough space and hiding spots is recommended.

## Breeding

Breeding Garra flavatra in captivity is considered challenging. A well-maintained environment with stable water
parameters is necessary for any successful breeding attempts. These fish require specific conditions that mimic their
natural habitat, and breeding behavior is rarely observed in home aquariums.
