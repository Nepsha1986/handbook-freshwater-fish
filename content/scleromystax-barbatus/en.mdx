## Overview

**Scleromystax barbatus**, commonly referred to as the **Bearded Corydoras** or **Bearded Catfish**, is a strikingly
distinct species found in the coastal rivers of Brazil. Known for its long whisker-like barbels, it grows to a length of
8-12 cm. This peaceful bottom-dweller thrives in community tanks and can live up to 5-7 years with proper care. Its
beautiful patterned body and calm nature make it a popular choice for aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

The **Bearded Corydoras** requires a spacious aquarium of at least 100 liters. The water should be maintained at a
temperature of 20-25Â°C, with a pH level between 6.0-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of 2-15. They prefer soft, sandy
substrate to protect their delicate barbels and enjoy a well-planted tank with plenty of hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Scleromystax barbatus** primarily feeds on small invertebrates found at the bottom of the riverbed. In
captivity, they readily accept sinking pellets, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. It
is important to ensure food reaches the bottom of the tank, as they are bottom feeders.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of about 25% are essential for maintaining water quality. The **Bearded Corydoras** prefers
well-oxygenated water with a gentle flow. Keep the substrate clean, as they sift through it regularly. Monitoring water
parameters is necessary to ensure stability and prevent any sudden fluctuations that could stress the fish.

## Compatibility

This peaceful species can be kept in community tanks with other non-aggressive fish. Ideal tank mates include tetras,
small rasboras, and other peaceful bottom-dwellers. Avoid housing them with large or aggressive species, as this may
lead to stress. **Scleromystax barbatus** tends to be more social when kept in small groups.

## Breeding

Breeding **Scleromystax barbatus** is possible but can be challenging. To encourage spawning, simulate the rainy season
by lowering the water temperature and performing frequent water changes. Males tend to develop long, bristly barbels
during breeding periods. Once eggs are laid, they should be removed to a separate tank for hatching. Feed the fry fine
foods like infusoria or specially formulated fry food.
