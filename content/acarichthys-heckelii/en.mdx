## Overview

**Acarichthys heckelii**, commonly known as Heckel's Cichlid, is a freshwater fish native to the Amazon River basin in
South America. This species typically reaches a size of 12-15 cm and has a lifespan of 5 to 10 years.

Heckel's Cichlid is known for its striking coloration, which can include shades of blue, yellow, and green, and for its
intriguing behaviors, including parental care and territorial displays.

## Tank Requirements

**Acarichthys heckelii** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and a general hardness
(GH) between 5-15 dGH. The ideal temperature for their habitat is between 24-28Â°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 150 liters.

Providing plenty of hiding spots and territories is essential, as these fish can be territorial, especially during
breeding. A well-planted aquarium with rocky structures can create a suitable environment for them.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Acarichthys heckelii** are omnivorous and feed on a variety of foods, including small invertebrates,
plant matter, and detritus. In captivity, they readily accept high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen or live foods
such as brine shrimp and bloodworms.

To maintain their health, it's important to provide a varied diet that includes both protein-rich and vegetable-based
foods. Feeding should occur once or twice daily, ensuring they consume their meals within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Heckel's Cichlid requires regular maintenance to thrive. Weekly water changes of 20-30% are recommended to keep the
water clean and stable. A reliable filtration system is crucial to maintain good water quality and oxygenation.

Monitoring water parameters closely is essential, as fluctuations can stress the fish. Providing a stable environment
with consistent water conditions will promote their health and well-being.

## Compatibility

**Acarichthys heckelii** can be kept with other semi-aggressive cichlids and peaceful fish that share similar water
parameters. Suitable tankmates include larger tetras, catfish, and other medium-sized fish.

Avoid keeping them with small or overly aggressive species, as they may be bullied or stressed. Providing plenty of
space and hiding spots can help reduce territorial disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding **Acarichthys heckelii** in captivity can be rewarding but requires careful planning. They are mouthbrooders,
with females incubating eggs in their mouths until the fry are ready to swim freely.

Setting up a breeding tank with flat surfaces for spawning can increase the chances of successful breeding. Once the fry
are free-swimming, they should be fed infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to consume standard
flake foods.
