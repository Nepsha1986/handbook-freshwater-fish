## Overview

**Acarichthys heckelii**, or Acarichthys Heckelii, is a freshwater fish native to the Amazon River basin in South
America. Typically, it reaches a length of 12–15 cm in an aquarium, although in larger tanks, it can grow up to 20 cm,
with a lifespan ranging from 5 to 10 years.

Acarichthys Heckelii is easily recognizable by its striking coloration, which includes hues of blue, yellow, and green.
These fish are known for their complex behavior, including parental care and territorial defense, making them a popular
choice among experienced aquarists.

Acarichthys heckelii can exhibit changes in coloration depending on mood, health, and breeding stage. During breeding,
the coloration becomes more vivid, especially in males, to attract females and mark their territory.

### Sexual Dimorphism

Males and females of **Acarichthys heckelii** show several noticeable differences, especially during the breeding season
or once they reach maturity.

- Males are generally larger and bulkier than females, with longer and more pointed dorsal and anal fins.
- During breeding, males become more colorful, with intensified hues and a stronger sheen, while females are usually
  less vibrant and have a softer coloration.
- Some adult males may have a small nuchal hump, which is absent in females.
- Males tend to be more aggressive and are inclined to guard their territory. During breeding, they actively court
  females, displaying their fins and colors.

## Aquarium Requirements

**Acarichthys heckelii** thrives in slightly acidic or neutral water with a pH of 6.5–7.5 and water hardness (GH) of
5–15 dGH. The water temperature should range from 24–28°C. A tank of at least 250 liters is recommended for a pair,
especially if a group is planned.

Creating a comfortable environment involves a harmonious combination of hiding spots, plants, and open swimming space.
Driftwood, large rocks, or ceramic structures can provide shelter, ensuring the fish feel safe and have private areas.
Dense plants like Echinodorus, Anubias, or Cryptocoryne can create shaded zones and help reduce stress. It's also
important to leave enough open swimming space in the center of the aquarium since these fish enjoy swimming actively and
exploring their surroundings.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, which consists of slow-moving or stagnant waters with sandy bottoms in the Amazon basin, this
species feeds on:

- **Small invertebrates**: such as insect larvae, crustaceans, and worms.
- **Plant material**: algae, detritus, and organic particles.
- **Zooplankton**: microscopic organisms found in the water column.

Their diet primarily consists of food found in the sand. They often sift sand through their gills to extract food,
making them effective "substrate filters."

In the aquarium, their diet should be as close to their natural one as possible, with high-quality foods like frozen or
live foods, as well as plant supplements.

### Recommended Diet:

- **Protein sources**: Frozen or live foods (such as Artemia, Daphnia, bloodworms).
- **Plant supplements**: Spirulina, blanched vegetables (e.g., zucchini or spinach).
- **Main food**: High-quality flakes or pellets.

Feed the fish 1–2 times a day, ensuring that all food is consumed within a few minutes. Excess food can negatively
affect water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

For the health and longevity of Acarichthys Heckelii, regular care procedures should be followed:

- Weekly water changes (20–30%) to maintain stable parameters.
- Use a powerful filter to ensure good filtration and aeration.
- Constantly monitor water parameters using test kits.

**Acarichthys heckelii**'s resilience to stress depends on stable conditions. Sudden changes in temperature or water
composition can lead to illness.

## Compatibility

**Acarichthys heckelii** is a relatively peaceful fish, but its compatibility with other species depends on the aquarium
conditions and the temperament of its tankmates. Below are recommendations for compatibility:

- **Other cichlids**: Generally, Acarichthys heckelii can coexist with other peaceful cichlids, especially those that
  are not overly territorial. However, it is best to avoid aggressive or overly dominant cichlids, as Acarichthys may
  become stressed or aggressive in response to their behavior.
- **Tetras and small characins**: These species generally get along well with Acarichthys. Peaceful fish such as tetras
  (e.g., Neon Tetras) or small characins can make good tankmates. However, very small fish may be at risk if they become
  prey for the larger cichlid.
- **Catfish**: Non-aggressive fish like **Corydoras** or **Ancistrus** can be suitable companions, as Acarichthys
  typically does not bother bottom-dwelling fish.

Overall, Acarichthys heckelii is best kept in a peaceful aquarium with similarly sized and temperamental tankmates. It’s
important to provide enough space for each fish to establish its territory and avoid overcrowding.

It is advised to avoid keeping them with small or timid species that may be subjected to attack. Providing shelters and
clearly defined territorial boundaries helps minimize conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding **Acarichthys heckelii** is an intriguing process that requires a prepared aquarium. These fish are
mouthbrooders: the female incubates the eggs in her mouth, protecting the fry until they are free-swimming.

### Breeding Recommendations:

Although these fish are relatively peaceful outside of the breeding season, they can become extremely territorial and
aggressive, especially towards other fish that approach their nest.

- Raise the water temperature to 27–28°C.
- Include flat stones or ceramic surfaces in the aquarium for breeding.
- After the fry are born, feed them infusoria, Artemia, or finely ground dry food.

Breeding requires patience, but observing the female’s care for her offspring is one of the most fascinating phenomena
in aquarium keeping.
