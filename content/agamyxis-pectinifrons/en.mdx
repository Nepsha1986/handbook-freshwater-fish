## Overview

**Agamyxis pectinifrons**, commonly known as the **Spotted Raphael Catfish** or **Talking Catfish**, is a peaceful,
nocturnal catfish species native to the Amazon Basin. It is named "Talking Catfish" due to the sounds it makes when
handled or stressed. This species has a beautiful spotted appearance and can grow up to 15-18 cm in length. They are
popular for their hardy nature and ability to clean the aquarium by scavenging for food.

## Tank Requirements

**Agamyxis pectinifrons** requires a large tank with a minimum volume of 150 liters. The ideal water temperature should
range from 23-27Â°C, with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5 and a water hardness (GH) between 6 and 12. The tank should
provide plenty of hiding spots using driftwood, caves, or thick plants, as this species is primarily nocturnal and
prefers a dimly lit environment.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Spotted Raphael Catfish** are scavengers, feeding on insects, small invertebrates, and organic matter. In
captivity, they will eat sinking pellets, live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, and occasional vegetable matter like
zucchini. Their nocturnal nature means they prefer to eat in the evening or at night. Ensure they receive enough food if
housed with more aggressive or faster-eating tankmates.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Agamyxis pectinifrons** is relatively easy as they are hardy and tolerant of a range of water conditions.
Regular water changes of 20-30% per week will help maintain a clean and healthy environment. This species is resistant
to many common diseases but can be sensitive to medications, so care should be taken when treating the tank.

## Compatibility

**Spotted Raphael Catfish** are peaceful and can be kept with a wide variety of tank mates. Suitable companions include
other non-aggressive bottom dwellers like corydoras or peaceful mid-level swimmers like tetras and rasboras. Avoid
keeping them with overly aggressive fish or species that may compete for hiding spaces.

## Breeding

Breeding **Agamyxis pectinifrons** in captivity is rare and difficult. They are egg scatterers, but breeding behavior is
rarely observed in home aquariums. To encourage breeding, soft, slightly acidic water and dense plant cover may be
helpful. However, most specimens available in the aquarium trade are wild-caught.
