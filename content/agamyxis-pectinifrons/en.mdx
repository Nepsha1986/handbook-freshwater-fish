## Overview

The Spotted Raphael Catfish, _Agamyxis pectinifrons_, is a popular and robust member of the Doradidae family, native to
the Amazon River basin in South America. This species is renowned for its striking appearance, featuring a dark body
covered in white or yellowish spots, and its ability to produce audible clicking or grunting sounds, especially when
agitated, earning it the nickname "Talking Catfish." Growing to about 6 inches (15 cm), it is a nocturnal and reclusive
fish that adds a lot of character to a community aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum of a 30-gallon (114 liters) aquarium is recommended for a single Spotted Raphael Catfish, with a larger tank
being necessary for a group. The substrate should be soft sand or smooth, fine gravel to protect their sensitive barbels
as they forage. They are not demanding about water parameters but thrive in a temperature range of 75-82°F (24-28°C), a
pH of 6.0-7.5, and soft to moderately hard water.

Being nocturnal, they require a dimly lit environment with plenty of hiding places. A network of caves, driftwood
tangles, and PVC pipes is essential for their well-being, as they will spend the majority of the daylight hours
concealed.

## Feeding and Diet

Spotted Raphael Catfish are omnivorous scavengers and are not picky eaters. Their diet should consist of high-quality
sinking pellets or wafers as a staple. This should be supplemented with a variety of meaty foods, such as frozen or live
bloodworms, brine shrimp, and earthworms. They will also appreciate occasional vegetable matter. To ensure they are
well-fed, it is best to offer food in the evening or after the main aquarium lights are turned off.

## Care and Maintenance

This is a very hardy and long-lived species, often living for 10 years or more with proper care. Regular water changes
are important to maintain good water quality. One of the most important aspects of their care is to be cautious when
netting them. The sharp, serrated pectoral and dorsal spines can easily become entangled in a net, causing stress and
potential injury to both the fish and the aquarist. It is safer to herd them into a solid container for transport.

## Compatibility

_Agamyxis pectinifrons_ is a peaceful and social fish that can be kept singly or in groups. They are compatible with a
wide range of medium to large-sized, peaceful community fish. Good tankmates include larger tetras, peaceful cichlids
like the [Blue Acara](/en/aequidens-pulcher), and other robust bottom dwellers. They are generally peaceful, but may eat
very small fish that can fit into their mouths, so they should not be housed with tiny species like neon tetras or small
fry.

## Breeding

Breeding the Spotted Raphael Catfish in a home aquarium is extremely rare and not well-documented. They are believed to
be egg-layers, but the specific triggers for spawning are not fully understood. The vast majority of specimens available
in the aquarium trade are wild-caught.
