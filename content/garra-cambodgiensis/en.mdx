## Overview

Garra cambodgiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian Garra or Cambodian Algae Eater, is a peaceful freshwater fish from
Southeast Asia. Known for its effective algae-eating capabilities, this species has a sleek, elongated body and thrives
in fast-flowing streams. It is popular in aquariums for its ability to help maintain a clean environment.

## Tank Requirements

Garra cambodgiensis requires a tank of at least 100 liters. The water temperature should range between 22-28Â°C, with a
pH level of 6.5-8.0 and a water hardness (GH) of 6-15 dGH. The tank should have moderate to strong water flow to mimic
its natural habitat, with smooth rocks and driftwood for hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, this species feeds primarily on algae and biofilm. In captivity, it should be offered a variety of sinking
algae wafers, blanched vegetables, and occasional protein-rich foods like bloodworms. Their diet helps maintain their
health and aids in algae control in the aquarium.

## Care and Maintenance

To maintain optimal health, regular water changes and tank cleaning are essential. Monitor water parameters weekly, and
ensure that the tank is clean and free of debris. While generally hardy, Garra cambodgiensis can be prone to stress if
kept in improper conditions.

## Compatibility

Garra cambodgiensis is a peaceful fish, suitable for community tanks. It gets along well with other non-aggressive
species. Avoid housing it with highly territorial or aggressive fish, as this can cause stress or injury. Ideal tank
mates include peaceful bottom-dwellers and mid-level swimmers.

## Breeding

Breeding Garra cambodgiensis in captivity is challenging. It requires well-established tanks with consistent water
parameters. Little is known about the specific breeding triggers for this species, but providing a clean, stable
environment with ample hiding spots may encourage spawning.
