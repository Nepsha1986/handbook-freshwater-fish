## Overview

**Aphyosemion striatum**, commonly known as the Striped Killifish, is a striking species known for its vibrant
coloration and horizontal stripes running along its body. Native to slow-moving waters in West Africa, this small fish
reaches about 4-5 cm in length and is well-suited for planted aquariums.

With a lifespan of around 2-3 years, **Aphyosemion striatum** is relatively easy to care for and thrives in peaceful
community tanks. Its calm nature makes it an excellent addition to planted setups, where it enjoys hiding among plants.

## Tank Requirements

**Aphyosemion striatum** thrives in smaller aquariums with a volume of 30 liters or more. The water temperature should
be maintained between 20-24°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 and water hardness (GH) between 1-10. A heavily planted
aquarium with low lighting is ideal, as this species prefers shaded areas.

Because it comes from environments with low water movement, avoid strong filtration. A gentle filter will help replicate
their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Aphyosemion striatum** feeds on small insects, larvae, and invertebrates. In captivity, they readily
accept a variety of foods such as high-quality micro-pellets, live or frozen brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. A
balanced diet with both live and dry foods ensures that they stay healthy and maintain their bright colors.

## Care and Maintenance

While **Aphyosemion striatum** is a hardy species, it does best in stable water conditions. Regular water changes and
careful monitoring of water parameters are important. Since they are small and peaceful, they are sensitive to the
presence of larger or aggressive fish, so they should be housed with other similarly peaceful species.

## Compatibility

**Aphyosemion striatum** is a peaceful fish and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive species. Ideal tank mates
include small tetras, rasboras, and dwarf shrimp. Avoid keeping them with larger or more aggressive fish that may stress
them out.

They can be housed in pairs or small groups, but ensure that the aquarium has enough hiding spots, such as plants and
driftwood, to reduce stress.

## Breeding

Breeding **Aphyosemion striatum** is relatively easy in a well-planted aquarium. They are egg-layers, and females will
deposit eggs on fine-leaved plants or spawning mops. Eggs typically hatch in about 10-14 days, depending on the water
temperature. The fry should be fed with infusoria or other microfoods, and as they grow, they can be introduced to baby
brine shrimp. For best breeding results, it’s important to remove the fry or provide ample cover, as adults may eat the
young.
