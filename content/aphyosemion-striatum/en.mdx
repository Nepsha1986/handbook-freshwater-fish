aliases: [Striped Killifish, Five-Striped Killifish, Aphyosemion striatum]
excerpt:

  small planted aquariums.

## Overview

The Red-Striped Killifish (_Aphyosemion striatum_) is one of the most attractive members of the family Nothobranchiidae.
This species originates from small forest streams and swampy pools in Gabon, West Africa, where it inhabits shaded areas
with slow current and abundant leaf litter.

Adults reach a size of 4–5 cm, with a lifespan of 2–3 years. Males are stunningly beautiful: their bodies are covered
with vivid red horizontal stripes on a golden-green background, and their fins are adorned with red and blue markings.
Females are more modestly colored in beige-brown tones with a less pronounced pattern.

Unlike many relatives in its family, _Aphyosemion striatum_ is not a seasonal species — it does not require egg
diapause. This makes it one of the best killifish for beginners looking to explore this fascinating group of fish.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or small group of Red-Striped Killifish can be kept in an aquarium of at least **30 liters**. This species does
not need a lot of space but appreciates a well-designed setup.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 20–24 °C (68–75 °F)
- **pH:** 6.0–7.0
- **Hardness (GH):** 1–10 dGH

The aquascape should mimic the natural habitat — a shaded forest stream. Use a dark substrate, dense planting (Java
moss, cryptocorynes, ferns), floating plants for subdued lighting, plus driftwood and leaf litter (oak, Indian almond
leaves). Leaf litter slightly acidifies the water and gives it a natural yellowish tint, which benefits the fish's
well-being.

Filtration should be gentle — an air-driven sponge filter works best. Strong current causes stress in this species. The
tank must be covered with a tight-fitting lid, as killifish are excellent jumpers.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Aphyosemion striatum_ feeds on small insects, their larvae, and microscopic invertebrates. In captivity,
the fish readily accept a variety of foods but clearly prefer live and frozen items.

Recommended diet:

- **Live and frozen foods:** small bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, grindal worms, and microworms. These form the
  dietary foundation and ensure vibrant coloration.
- **Dry foods:** high-quality micro-pellets or flakes can be used as a supplement but should not be the primary diet.

Feed 1–2 times daily in small portions. Killifish are prone to overeating, so portions should be moderate. Dietary
variety is the key to good health and intense coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

_Aphyosemion striatum_ is a fairly hardy species, but stable water parameters are critically important. Key guidelines:

- **Water changes:** replace 15–20% of the volume weekly. Use dechlorinated water matched to the tank temperature.
- **Filtration:** an air-driven sponge filter is the optimal choice. It provides biological filtration without strong
  current.
- **Temperature control:** this species prefers cooler water. Avoid temperatures above 24 °C (75 °F) — elevated heat
  makes the fish lethargic and shortens their lifespan.
- **Parameter monitoring:** regularly test for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. Killifish are sensitive to the buildup
  of nitrogenous compounds.

Monitor the condition of leaf litter — replace leaves as they decompose, roughly every 2–3 weeks.

## Compatibility

The Red-Striped Killifish is a calm but somewhat territorial fish. Males can display aggression toward each other, so in
a smaller tank it is best to keep one male with one or two females.

Suitable tankmates:

- Small peaceful tetras: [ember tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae), [glowlight tetras](/en/hemigrammus-erythrozonus)
- Small rasboras: [chili rasboras](/en/boraras-brigittae)
- Dwarf corydoras: [pygmy corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus)
- Dwarf shrimp (with caution — killifish may eat shrimplets)
- Other killifish: [clown killifish](/en/epiplatys-annulatus)

Avoid large, active, or aggressive fish. [Bettas](/en/betta-splendens) and barbs are poor choices. The Red-Striped
Killifish will become stressed in a busy tank with fast-moving fish.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aphyosemion striatum_ is not particularly difficult and is accessible even to beginning aquarists.

**Preparation:**

- Set up a breeding tank of 10–15 liters with a sponge filter and fine-leaved plants (Java moss) or spawning mops.
- Water parameters: temperature 22–23 °C (72–73 °F), pH 6.0–6.5, soft water (GH 2–5).
- For a week before spawning, feed the breeders generously with live food.

**Spawning and raising fry:**

The male actively courts the female, displaying his spread fins. The female deposits a few eggs daily on fine-leaved
plants or spawning mops. Eggs can be collected every few days and transferred to a separate container with water from
the breeding tank.

Incubation lasts 10–14 days at 22–23 °C (72–73 °F). After hatching, the fry are relatively large and can immediately
accept baby brine shrimp and microworms. Growth is rapid — by 3–4 months the fish begin to show coloration, and by 5–6
months they reach sexual maturity.

Important: adults may eat eggs and fry, so for successful breeding it is best to remove the parents or regularly collect
eggs.
