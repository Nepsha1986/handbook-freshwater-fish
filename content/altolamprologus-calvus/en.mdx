## Overview

**Altolamprologus calvus**, known as the Calvus Cichlid, is a striking species of cichlid native to the rocky shores of
Lake Tanganyika in Africa. The species is easily recognizable due to its compressed body and elongated head with a
pointed snout, which allows it to navigate narrow crevices in search of food. It has a reputation for being a hardy and
adaptable aquarium resident, popular among aquarists for its unique appearance and relatively peaceful nature compared
to other cichlids.

## Tank Requirements

Calvus Cichlids require a minimum tank size of 100 liters (26 gallons) to accommodate their territorial behavior and
provide ample hiding spots. The water temperature should be kept between 23-27°C (73-81°F), with a pH range of 7.5-9.0
and a general hardness (GH) between 8-20. A rocky setup with plenty of caves and crevices is ideal, replicating their
natural habitat. Fine sand or smooth gravel substrate is recommended to protect their delicate underbellies.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Altolamprologus calvus primarily feeds on small invertebrates and crustaceans that they find within the
rocky substrate. In captivity, they can be fed a varied diet that includes high-quality cichlid pellets, frozen or live
foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Feeding small, frequent meals will help replicate their natural
foraging behavior and keep them healthy.

## Care and Maintenance

Altolamprologus calvus is relatively easy to care for, provided their tank is well-maintained and parameters are stable.
Weekly water changes of 20-30% are recommended to keep water quality high, and regular monitoring of pH and hardness is
crucial to avoid stress. It is also important to provide plenty of hiding spots to reduce aggression and ensure that the
tank setup mimics their natural environment closely.

## Compatibility

Calvus Cichlids are best kept with other species from Lake Tanganyika, including other small to medium-sized, peaceful
to semi-aggressive cichlids. They can coexist with similarly sized tank mates that share similar water parameters. Avoid
keeping them with overly aggressive or much larger fish, as well as very small fish that could be perceived as prey.

## Breeding

Breeding Altolamprologus calvus can be challenging due to their slow growth rate and selective breeding habits. They are
substrate spawners, often laying eggs in narrow crevices or shells. To encourage breeding, maintain optimal water
conditions and provide plenty of potential breeding sites. Once a pair has formed, they will defend their chosen
spawning site vigorously. After hatching, the fry can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp or specialized fry foods until
they are large enough to accept larger foods.
