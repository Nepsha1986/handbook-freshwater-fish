## Overview

**Boraras merah**, commonly referred to as the **Phoenix Rasbora**, is a tiny and vibrant fish originating from the
freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Known for its striking red-orange coloration, this
peaceful species is popular in nano aquariums. Despite its small size of 1.5-2 cm, it creates a beautiful contrast when
kept in planted tanks with dark substrates.

## Tank Requirements

Phoenix Rasboras are well-suited for nano tanks, requiring a minimum of 20 liters of water. They thrive in soft, acidic
water with a pH range of 5.5-7.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-12. Ideal water temperatures for this species range
between 22-28°C. The tank should be heavily planted with a gentle water flow and ample hiding spaces, such as driftwood
and leaf litter, which help replicate their natural habitat. Lighting should be moderate to low, and maintaining good
water quality is key.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Boraras merah primarily feeds on tiny invertebrates and zooplankton. In captivity, they will accept a
variety of small foods such as micro-pellets, high-quality flakes, and live or frozen foods like baby brine shrimp,
daphnia, and microworms. Feed them small amounts 1-2 times per day, ensuring the food is small enough to fit into their
tiny mouths.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Phoenix Rasboras is relatively easy as long as their tank is well-maintained. They require clean water with
regular weekly changes of around 25-30%. Because they are sensitive to poor water conditions, proper filtration is
essential. These fish thrive in well-planted environments, and tankmates should be equally small and peaceful. Phoenix
Rasboras are prone to stress if kept in inappropriate conditions, so careful monitoring of water parameters is
necessary.

## Compatibility

Phoenix Rasboras are peaceful and best kept in groups of 8 or more to feel secure. Their calm demeanor makes them
compatible with other small, peaceful species such as small tetras, dwarf shrimp, and pygmy Corydoras. Avoid housing
them with larger or aggressive species, as they can easily become stressed or bullied.

## Breeding

Breeding Boraras merah can be a challenge. To encourage breeding, set up a separate tank with soft, acidic water (pH
5.5-6.5) and a temperature around 26°C. Provide plenty of fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for the eggs. The parents
do not exhibit parental care, and eggs are often eaten, so it’s essential to remove adults once the eggs are laid. The
eggs hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to eat
microworms or baby brine shrimp.
