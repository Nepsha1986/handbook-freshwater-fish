## Overview

The Convict Cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is one of the most well-known and widespread cichlids in the aquarium
hobby. These fish are native to Central America, where they inhabit the rivers and streams of Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras, and Nicaragua. They get their name from the characteristic dark vertical stripes on a gray or bluish body
background. They are relatively small but stocky fish, reaching up to 15 cm in length, although females are usually
smaller (up to 10 cm). Convict Cichlids are famous for their "combative" character and strong parental instinct, which
makes observing them incredibly fascinating.

## Tank Requirements

An aquarium of at least 60 liters is suitable for a pair of Convict Cichlids. If you plan to keep them with other fish,
the volume should be at least 150-200 liters. These fish love to dig in the substrate, so it is best to use sand or fine
gravel. A large number of shelters is essential: rocks, caves, ceramic pots, and driftwood. Plants should be hardy and
well-rooted, as the cichlids may dig them up. Optimal water parameters: temperature 22-28°C, pH 6.5-8.0, hardness (GH)
8-20 dGH. Powerful filtration and aeration are necessary, as well as a weekly water change of 25-30%.

## Feeding and Diet

Convict Cichlids are omnivorous and not picky about food. The basis of their diet should be high-quality dry food for
cichlids (granules, sticks). As a supplement, it is necessary to give live or frozen foods: bloodworms, brine shrimp,
glass worms, daphnia. It is also useful to include plant components in the diet: blanched lettuce, spinach, nettle
leaves, or special foods with spirulina. A varied diet supports the health of the fish and enhances their coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

The main thing in caring for Convict Cichlids is to maintain cleanliness in the aquarium and stable water parameters.
Due to their habit of digging in the substrate and their relatively large size, they produce a lot of waste. Regular
substrate siphoning and water changes are mandatory. Watch the behavior of the fish: excessive aggression can be a sign
of overcrowding or improperly selected neighbors. Despite their feisty nature, they can suffer from larger and more
aggressive cichlids.

## Compatibility

Convict Cichlids are territorial and rather aggressive fish, especially during the breeding season. They should not be
kept with small and peaceful species (neons, guppies). Good neighbors would be other cichlids of similar size and
robustness from Central and South America (e.g., [Blue Acara](/en/aequidens-pulcher), [Severums](/en/heros-severus)), as
well as large catfish (plecos, ancistrus). In a spacious aquarium with plenty of shelters, conflicts will be minimized.
It is best to keep a formed pair.

## Breeding

Breeding Convict Cichlids is not difficult and often happens spontaneously. A stimulus for spawning is an increase in
temperature by 2-3°C and abundant feeding. The pair chooses a shelter (cave, pot) or a flat stone and thoroughly cleans
it. The female lays from 100 to 500 eggs, which the male immediately fertilizes. Both parents fiercely guard the clutch
and care for it. The incubation period lasts 2-3 days, and after another 3-4 days, the fry begin to swim. The starting
food is brine shrimp nauplii, infusoria, finely ground dry food. The parents care for the offspring for several weeks,
which is one of the most interesting aspects of their behavior.
