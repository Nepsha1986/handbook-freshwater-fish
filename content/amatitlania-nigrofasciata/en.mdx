## Overview

The Convict Cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a popular freshwater fish species belonging to the Cichlidae family.
Native to Central America, particularly in Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, these fish are easily recognized by their
striking black and white vertical stripes, which give them their common name. Convict Cichlids are known for their
aggressive behavior, especially during breeding, and are best suited for experienced aquarists. They typically grow to a
length of 10 to 13 cm and are highly territorial, often dominating other fish in the tank.

## Tank Requirements

Convict Cichlids require a tank of at least 110 liters to accommodate their territorial nature. They thrive in water
temperatures between 24-28Â°C, a pH level of 6.5 to 8.0, and a water hardness (GH) between 10-15. A tank with plenty of
hiding spots, such as rocks, caves, and driftwood, is essential to provide them with a sense of security. It's also
important to maintain a robust filtration system, as Convict Cichlids can be quite messy.

## Feeding and Diet

Convict Cichlids are omnivores with a varied diet in the wild, consisting of insects, small crustaceans, and plant
matter. In an aquarium, they can be fed high-quality pellets or flakes, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as
brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. They also enjoy occasional servings of vegetables like spinach or peas. Providing
a balanced diet will ensure their vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Convict Cichlids requires regular tank maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-25% and monitoring
water parameters to keep them stable. Due to their aggressive nature, it's crucial to watch for signs of stress or
injury in other tank inhabitants. Convict Cichlids are relatively hardy, but maintaining good water quality and
providing a suitable diet are key to preventing common diseases.

## Compatibility

Convict Cichlids are known for their aggressive and territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They are best kept
with other robust, similarly-sized fish that can hold their own, such as other cichlids or large catfish. It's advisable
to avoid keeping them with smaller or more peaceful species, as they may be bullied or injured. If keeping multiple
Convict Cichlids, ensure the tank is large enough to establish separate territories.

## Breeding

Breeding Convict Cichlids is relatively easy, as they are prolific breeders and form strong pair bonds. They lay eggs on
flat surfaces like rocks or aquarium glass, and the parents are known to be highly protective of their offspring. The
female typically lays 100-300 eggs, which hatch in 2-3 days. Fry should be fed crushed flake food or specialized fry
food until they are large enough to consume regular foods. It's essential to provide plenty of hiding spots for the fry
to ensure their survival.
