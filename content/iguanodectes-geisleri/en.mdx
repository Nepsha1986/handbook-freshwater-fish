## Overview

**Iguanodectes geisleri**, commonly known as _Geisler's Pike Tetra_, is a streamlined and fast-moving fish. Native to
South America, it inhabits clear, fast-flowing streams. Its sleek, torpedo-shaped body and reflective silver coloration
make it a stunning addition to larger aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

These tetras require a tank of at least 120 liters with ample swimming space. The water should be kept at temperatures
between 24–28°C, a pH of 6.0–7.5, and hardness levels of 3–12 dGH. Aquariums should be well-planted along the sides and
back, with open areas for swimming. Good water movement and high oxygen levels are essential, mimicking their natural
habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Geisler's Pike Tetras are omnivores and thrive on a varied diet. Feed them high-quality flakes or pellets, along with
live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. They also appreciate occasional vegetable-based
foods like spirulina flakes or blanched spinach.

## Care and Maintenance

This species requires clean, well-oxygenated water with regular water changes. They are relatively peaceful but can be
somewhat timid if kept in small groups, so a school of at least six individuals is recommended. Monitor water parameters
carefully, as they are sensitive to poor water quality.

## Compatibility

Geisler's Pike Tetras are peaceful and suitable for community tanks with other non-aggressive species. Good tankmates
include other tetras, rasboras, and dwarf cichlids. Avoid larger, predatory fish that might see them as prey.

## Breeding

Breeding Iguanodectes geisleri in captivity is challenging and rarely reported. A separate breeding tank with soft,
acidic water and dim lighting may encourage spawning. Condition the fish with live foods, and provide fine-leafed plants
or spawning mops for egg deposition. The eggs are adhesive and will hatch in about 24–36 hours. The fry should be fed
infusoria or liquid fry food initially, progressing to baby brine shrimp as they grow.
