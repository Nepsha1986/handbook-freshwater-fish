## Overview

**Pseudoplatystoma tigrinum**, commonly referred to as the _Tiger Shovelnose Catfish_, is a large and strikingly
patterned catfish native to the rivers of South America. Known for its tiger-like stripes and elongated body, this
species is popular among experienced aquarists with ample space and resources to meet its needs.

## Tank Requirements

This species requires a very large tank of at least 1000 liters to accommodate its adult size, which can reach up to 120
cm. Water conditions should include a temperature of 22–28°C, a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, and soft to moderately hard
water (GH 4–12). The tank should be equipped with robust filtration, as these fish produce significant waste, and
include hiding spots like large driftwood and caves.

## Feeding and Diet

Tiger Shovelnose Catfish are carnivorous predators that primarily feed on live or frozen foods, including fish, shrimp,
and other meaty items. In captivity, they can be trained to accept high-quality pellets, but a diet rich in protein is
essential for their health. Avoid feeding them feeder fish from unknown sources, as this can introduce disease.

## Care and Maintenance

Due to their size and predatory nature, Pseudoplatystoma tigrinum requires careful planning and significant upkeep.
Regular water changes and strong filtration are crucial to maintaining water quality. They are best suited for
experienced aquarists with the ability to house them long-term.

## Compatibility

This species can be kept with other large fish that are not small enough to be considered prey. Suitable tankmates
include similarly sized South American species, such as other large catfish or peaceful cichlids. Avoid keeping them
with smaller fish, as they will likely become food.

## Breeding

Breeding Tiger Shovelnose Catfish in captivity is exceedingly rare and typically requires large, specialized facilities.
In the wild, they spawn during the rainy season, and their breeding habits are tied to the flooding cycles of their
natural habitat.
