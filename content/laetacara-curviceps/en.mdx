## Overview

The Flag Acara (_Laetacara curviceps_), also known as the Curviceps Cichlid, is a small, peaceful dwarf cichlid native
to the calm waters of the Amazon River basin. This fish is appreciated for its vibrant colors and gentle nature, making
it an excellent choice for community tanks. The Flag Acara's adaptability and unique behaviors make it a popular species
among aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Flag Acaras thrive in well-maintained aquariums with a minimum volume of 80 liters. They prefer temperatures between
24-28Â°C, a pH range of 6.0-7.5, and water hardness (GH) of 5-12. Soft substrate and dense vegetation with hiding spots,
such as driftwood and rocks, are recommended to mimic their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes
are essential for keeping the water quality high.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Flag Acaras primarily feed on small invertebrates and plant matter. In the aquarium, they do well with a
varied diet of high-quality flakes or pellets, supplemented with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, and
bloodworms. Feeding them a balanced diet promotes vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

The Flag Acara is relatively hardy, but maintaining stable water conditions is important for their health. Weekly water
changes of 20-30% and regular tank maintenance are recommended. They are not prone to many diseases if kept in optimal
conditions, but stress or poor water quality can lead to health issues.

## Compatibility

Flag Acaras are peaceful and suitable for community tanks with other calm species. They can coexist with small,
non-aggressive fish, such as tetras, rasboras, and other dwarf cichlids. However, they may become territorial during
breeding, so providing ample hiding places can help reduce stress and potential conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Laetacara curviceps_ in captivity is possible with the right conditions. They are substrate spawners and
prefer flat surfaces, such as rocks or broad leaves, for egg-laying. To encourage breeding, maintain stable water
parameters
