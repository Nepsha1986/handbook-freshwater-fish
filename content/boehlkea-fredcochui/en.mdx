## Overview

The Blue Tetra (_Boehlkea fredcochui_) is a small, vibrant fish known for its shimmering blue coloration. Originally
from South American rivers, it thrives in well-maintained community tanks and adds a flash of color and activity. This
peaceful species is ideal for aquarists looking to create a lively, harmonious tank environment.

## Tank Requirements

Blue Tetras require a tank of at least 60 liters with water temperatures ranging from 22-28Â°C, a pH of 5.5-7.5, and a GH
of 2-12. They prefer soft, slightly acidic water and do best in a well-decorated tank with plenty of open swimming
space. A darker substrate enhances their coloration, while plants and driftwood can create a natural, shaded
environment.

## Feeding and Diet

As omnivores, Blue Tetras are not picky eaters. They thrive on a varied diet of high-quality flakes, small pellets, and
occasional treats such as brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. Feeding them twice daily in small portions keeps them
healthy and active.

## Care and Maintenance

Blue Tetras are relatively easy to care for, requiring regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and good filtration.
Monitoring water parameters is important, as they are sensitive to poor water quality. Proper lighting and tank
cleanliness help maintain their vibrant coloration and health.

## Compatibility

Blue Tetras are peaceful, making them suitable for community tanks with other small, non-aggressive fish. They are
schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least six to prevent stress and encourage natural behavior. Suitable
tank mates include other tetras, rasboras, and small catfish.

## Breeding

Breeding Blue Tetras in captivity can be challenging due to specific water conditions required for spawning. They are
egg scatterers, and a separate breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water is recommended. Providing fine-leaved
plants or a spawning mop can help collect the eggs. After spawning, the parents should be removed to prevent egg
predation.
