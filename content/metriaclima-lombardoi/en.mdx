## Overview

**Metriaclima lombardoi**, commonly known as the Kenyi Cichlid, is a highly aggressive species native to Lake Malawi in
Africa. This fish is famous for its vibrant blue and yellow coloration, with males typically turning bright yellow as
they mature.

These cichlids grow to 12-15 cm and can live up to 7-10 years under proper care. They are best suited for experienced
aquarists due to their territorial nature and aggressive tendencies, especially in smaller aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Kenyi Cichlids thrive in tanks with temperatures between 24-28Â°C, a pH of 7.8-8.6, and a hardness (GH) of 10-18. A tank
size of at least 200 liters is recommended to provide enough space for multiple territories.

Since they are rock-dwelling fish in the wild, an aquarium with plenty of rocks and caves will replicate their natural
habitat and give them the necessary hiding spots to establish territories. Sand or fine gravel can be used as a
substrate.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Metriaclima lombardoi** feeds primarily on algae and plant matter. In captivity, they should be provided
with a diet rich in spirulina-based foods, along with vegetable matter. They can also eat occasional protein-based
foods, such as brine shrimp or bloodworms, but these should be offered sparingly to avoid digestive issues.

A balanced diet will promote their vibrant colors and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Kenyi Cichlids require stable water parameters and regular maintenance to stay healthy. Since they are sensitive to poor
water quality, weekly water changes of at least 20-30% are essential, and a powerful filtration system is recommended to
maintain clean water conditions.

They are best kept in species-specific tanks or with other aggressive African cichlids from Lake Malawi, ensuring that
the tank is large enough to prevent constant fighting.

## Compatibility

**Metriaclima lombardoi** is highly territorial and aggressive, especially the males. They should be kept in larger
groups to spread out aggression, with one male to several females. Keeping multiple males together often leads to
serious conflicts.

They are best housed with other Mbuna cichlids that can handle their aggressive nature. Avoid mixing them with peaceful
species or those from different regions, as they may become targets for harassment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Kenyi Cichlids** is relatively easy in the right conditions. They are mouthbrooders, with the female carrying
the fertilized eggs and fry in her mouth until they are ready to be released. It is important to provide separate hiding
areas for the females, as they may be harassed by males during breeding.

The fry are relatively easy to raise, accepting crushed flakes or specialized fry food soon after release.
