## Overview

**Corydoras atropersonatus**, also known as the Black-Spotted Corydoras or Atropersonatus Cory, is a small and peaceful
freshwater catfish from the family Callichthyidae. Native to the rivers of South America, particularly in Peru and
Ecuador, this species is characterized by its distinctive black spots scattered across a light, creamy body. It
typically reaches a size of 4-5 cm (1.6-2 inches) and has a lifespan of 5-8 years in captivity. Its gentle nature makes
it an excellent choice for community aquariums, especially with other small, non-aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

Corydoras atropersonatus thrives in a tank that mimics its natural habitat. A minimum tank volume of 50 liters (13
gallons) is recommended. The ideal water temperature ranges between 22-26째C (72-79째F), with a pH of 6.0-7.5 and a
general hardness (GH) of 2-12. A soft, sandy substrate is essential to protect their delicate barbels, which they use to
search for food at the bottom of the tank. Adding plenty of hiding spots with driftwood, rocks, and aquatic plants will
provide comfort and reduce stress for these shy fish. Ensure good water quality with proper filtration and regular water
changes to maintain a healthy environment.

## Feeding and Diet

Corydoras atropersonatus is an omnivorous species with a diet consisting of small invertebrates, plant matter, and
detritus in the wild. In an aquarium setting, they should be fed a varied diet that includes high-quality sinking
pellets or wafers, along with frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Offering occasional
blanched vegetables, like spinach or zucchini, can help provide balanced nutrition and mimic their natural diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Corydoras atropersonatus is relatively straightforward, making them suitable for both beginners and
experienced aquarists. Regular maintenance, including weekly water changes of 20-30%, is essential to maintain water
quality and prevent the build-up of harmful substances. Ensure the substrate is soft to prevent injury to their
sensitive barbels, and avoid introducing sharp objects or decorations that might damage them. A peaceful environment
with minimal disturbances will help these fish thrive and exhibit their natural behaviors.

## Compatibility

The Black-Spotted Corydoras is a peaceful species that does well in a community tank with other small, non-aggressive
fish. They are best kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals, which helps reduce stress and encourages natural
schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include small tetras, rasboras, guppies, and other peaceful bottom dwellers.
Avoid keeping them with large or aggressive species that could outcompete them for food or pose a threat to their
well-being.

## Breeding

Breeding Corydoras atropersonatus in captivity can be challenging but is possible with the right conditions. To
encourage spawning, maintain stable water parameters and provide plenty of hiding spots. Gradually increase the water
temperature to around 26째C (79째F) and perform frequent small water changes to simulate the rainy season, which often
triggers breeding behavior. Females will deposit eggs on flat surfaces such as leaves or aquarium glass. Since parents
do not care for the eggs, it is advisable to move them to a separate breeding tank to prevent them from being eaten by
other fish. The eggs usually hatch in about 3-5 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or commercially prepared fry
food until they are large enough to consume finely crushed flakes or microworms.
