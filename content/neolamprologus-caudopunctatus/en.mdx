## Overview

The Caudopunctatus Cichlid (_Neolamprologus caudopunctatus_) is a captivating cichlid species native to the rocky shores
of Lake Tanganyika in Africa. Known for the distinctive spots on its caudal fin, this species is a favorite among
aquarists for its peaceful demeanor and striking appearance. These small cichlids are well-suited for community tanks
with other peaceful fish.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 80 liters is recommended for the Caudopunctatus Cichlid. Ideal water conditions include a temperature
range of 23-27Â°C, pH levels of 7.5 to 9.0, and a GH between 8 and 20. They thrive in tanks with rocky formations that
provide plenty of hiding spots, along with a sandy substrate to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Caudopunctatus Cichlids are omnivores, feeding on small invertebrates and algae. In the aquarium, they do
well on a varied diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with occasional live or frozen foods such as brine
shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms.

## Care and Maintenance

These cichlids require regular tank maintenance to ensure stable water conditions. Weekly water changes of around 20-25%
are recommended. As they are sensitive to poor water quality, good filtration and routine monitoring of water parameters
are essential.

## Compatibility

Caudopunctatus Cichlids are generally peaceful and can be housed with other small, non-aggressive fish. However, they
can be territorial, particularly during breeding, so provide plenty of hiding spots and consider tank mates carefully.
Other Tanganyikan species with similar temperaments make ideal tank mates.

## Breeding

Breeding Caudopunctatus Cichlids in captivity is achievable. They are substrate spawners, typically laying their eggs in
small crevices or rock caves. Once the fry hatch, both parents are attentive caregivers, protecting the young until they
are ready to fend for themselves.
