## Overview

**Channa pardalis**, commonly known as **Leopard Snakehead** or **Spotted Snakehead**, is a strikingly patterned
freshwater predator fish native to the rivers and lakes of Southeast Asia. This medium-sized species can grow up to
25-30 cm and typically lives for 8-12 years. Its distinctive leopard-like spots and sleek body make it a visually
impressive addition to any aquarium, though its territorial and aggressive nature requires careful management of tank
mates.

## Tank Requirements

For **Leopard Snakehead**, a minimum tank size of 150 liters is recommended. They thrive in water temperatures between
22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of 5-12. Provide plenty of hiding places, such as caves,
rocks, and vegetation, to create an environment where they can feel secure. A secure lid is essential as this species is
prone to jumping.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Channa pardalis** feeds on smaller fish, crustaceans, and insects. In captivity, they can be fed live or
frozen food such as shrimp, feeder fish, and high-quality carnivore pellets. It's important to offer a variety of foods
to maintain their health and color. Feed them 2-3 times a week, avoiding overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

**Channa pardalis** requires clean, well-filtered water to stay healthy. Regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
recommended to maintain water quality. They are hardy fish, but care should be taken to avoid drastic changes in water
conditions, as this can lead to stress and illness. Regular monitoring of water parameters is important for their
well-being.

## Compatibility

Due to their territorial and sometimes aggressive nature, **Leopard Snakeheads** should be housed with caution. They can
be kept with other robust species that are of similar size and temperament, but smaller fish are at risk of being
attacked. It is often best to keep them in a species-only tank to avoid aggression toward tank mates.

## Breeding

Breeding **Channa pardalis** in captivity can be challenging due to their territorial behavior. Mating pairs should be
provided with a large tank that allows them to establish their own territory. The female lays eggs in a secluded area,
and the male guards them. Once the fry hatch, they should be separated and fed with specialized fry food until they grow
large enough to be moved to the main tank.
