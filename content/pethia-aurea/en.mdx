## Overview

The Golden Barb (Pethia aurea) is a small, colorful fish belonging to the Cyprinidae family. Originating from freshwater
rivers and streams in Myanmar, this species is well-known for its striking golden coloration and peaceful temperament.
Growing to a size of 2.5 cm, the Golden Barb is a popular choice among aquarists for its hardiness and ease of care. It
is well-suited for community tanks and adds a splash of color to any aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

Golden Barbs are best kept in well-planted aquariums with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They prefer water temperatures
between 22-28Â°C, a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5, and water hardness (GH) between 5-12. The tank should be equipped with a
gentle filter to simulate their natural habitat of slow-moving waters. Adding plants, driftwood, and rocks will provide
hiding places and help make the fish feel secure.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Golden Barbs feed on small invertebrates, algae, and plant matter. In an aquarium setting,
they will thrive on a diet of high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine
shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. It's important to offer a varied diet to ensure they receive all necessary nutrients.
Feed them twice a day in small amounts.

## Care and Maintenance

Golden Barbs are easy to care for and make a great choice for both beginners and experienced aquarists. Regular water
changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended to maintain water quality. These fish are relatively hardy but should still be
monitored for common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Maintaining stable water parameters and providing a
stress-free environment will help keep them healthy.

## Compatibility

Golden Barbs are peaceful fish that do well with other small, non-aggressive species. They are best kept in groups of at
least six individuals, which helps to reduce any potential aggression. Suitable tank mates include tetras, rasboras, and
other small barbs. Avoid housing them with larger, more aggressive fish that might bully or outcompete them.

## Breeding

Breeding Golden Barbs can be achieved in a well-maintained aquarium. These fish are egg scatterers, and spawning can be
induced by slightly raising the water temperature and providing a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants. After
spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 24-48 hours, and the
fry can be fed infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp once they become free-swimming.
