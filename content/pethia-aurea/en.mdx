## Overview

The Golden Barb (_Pethia aurea_) is a small, colorful fish belonging to the Cyprinidae family. Native to the freshwater
rivers and streams of Myanmar, this species is renowned for its striking golden coloration and peaceful temperament.
Growing to a size of 2.5–3 cm, the Golden Barb is popular among aquarists due to its hardiness and ease of care. It is
an excellent choice for community aquariums and adds a splash of color to any aquatic setup.

## Aquarium Requirements

Golden Barbs thrive in densely planted aquariums with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They prefer water temperatures
between 22–28°C, a pH range of 6.0–7.5, and water hardness (GH) of 5–12 dGH. A gentle filter should be installed to
mimic their natural habitat in slow-moving waters. Adding plants, driftwood, and rocks will provide hiding spots and
help the fish feel secure. Lighting should be moderate, as bright light can cause stress.

### Water Parameters:

- **Temperature:** 22–28°C
- **pH:** 6.0–7.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 5–12 dGH
- **Filtration:** Gentle, with moderate flow

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Golden Barbs feed on small invertebrates, algae, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they do well on a diet
of high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and
bloodworms. A varied diet is essential to ensure they receive all necessary nutrients. Feed them twice a day in small
portions to avoid overfeeding and water pollution.

### Recommended Foods:

- Flakes or pellets for small tropical fish
- Live or frozen foods (brine shrimp, daphnia, bloodworms)
- Plant-based supplements (spirulina, blanched vegetables)

## Care and Maintenance

Golden Barbs are easy to care for and are suitable for both beginners and experienced aquarists. Regular water changes
of 20–30% weekly are recommended to maintain water quality. While these fish are relatively hardy, they should still be
monitored for common diseases such as ich (white spot disease) or fin rot. Maintaining stable water parameters and
providing a stress-free environment will help keep them healthy.

### Care Tips:

- Regularly test water parameters using a test kit.
- Avoid sudden changes in temperature or pH.
- Ensure good aeration and filtration.

## Compatibility

Golden Barbs are peaceful fish that get along well with other small, non-aggressive species. They are best kept in
groups of at least six individuals, which helps reduce any potential aggression and encourages natural behavior.
Suitable tankmates include tetras, rasboras, small catfish (such as Corydoras), and other small barbs. Avoid keeping
them with larger, aggressive fish that may bully or outcompete them.

### Recommended Tankmates:

- Tetras (neons, glowlight tetras)
- Rasboras (e.g., [harlequin rasbora](/en/trigonostigma-heteromorpha))
- Corydoras catfish
- Other small barbs (e.g., [cherry barb](/en/puntius-titteya))

## Breeding

Breeding Golden Barbs is achievable in a well-maintained aquarium. They are egg-scatterers, and spawning can be induced
by slightly raising the water temperature to 26–28°C and providing a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants
(e.g., Java moss). After spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs hatch
within 24–48 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp once they become free-swimming.

### Breeding Tips:

- Use a breeding tank of 20–30 liters.
- Maintain a temperature of 26–28°C.
- Ensure soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.5–7.0).
- Feed the fry 2–3 times a day with small foods.

## Interesting Facts

- **Social Behavior:** Golden Barbs are schooling fish, and their behavior becomes more active and interesting in
  groups.
- **Color Variations:** Depending on conditions and diet, their coloration can range from pale yellow to vibrant gold.
- **Lifespan:** With proper care, Golden Barbs can live for 3–5 years.

## Conclusion

The Golden Barb (_Pethia aurea_) is an excellent choice for aquarists looking to add color and activity to their
aquarium. Thanks to their hardiness, peaceful nature, and ease of care, these fish are suitable for both beginners and
experienced hobbyists. By providing the right conditions, a balanced diet, and proper care, you can enjoy their beauty
and lively behavior for many years.
