## Overview

_Pseudotropheus zebra_, commonly known as the Zebra Cichlid or Zebra Mbuna, is a strikingly colorful fish native to Lake
Malawi in Africa. This cichlid is renowned for its eye-catching vertical stripes, which can be blue, yellow, or a mix of
both, depending on the variant. The Zebra Cichlid is an active and somewhat territorial species, making it a fascinating
but demanding addition to a community tank.

## Tank Requirements

Zebra Cichlids thrive in well-maintained aquariums with a minimum volume of 150 liters. They prefer a temperature range
of 24-28°C and a pH level between 7.8 and 8.6, reflecting their natural habitat in Lake Malawi. The tank should be
equipped with plenty of rocks and caves to create hiding spots and territories. A sandy substrate is ideal, as it mimics
their natural environment. Good filtration and regular water changes are crucial for maintaining water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Pseudotropheus zebra_ is an omnivorous species with a diet that should include a mix of high-quality cichlid pellets,
flakes, and occasional live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. In the wild, they feed on
algae, small invertebrates, and detritus. Providing a varied diet will help maintain their vibrant coloration and
overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Zebra Cichlids involves ensuring stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform weekly water
changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues such as ich or fin rot
and address any problems promptly. Due to their territorial nature, providing ample hiding places and avoiding
overcrowding will help reduce stress and aggressive behavior.

## Compatibility

_Pseudotropheus zebra_ is relatively aggressive compared to some other cichlid species, especially towards other males
and during breeding. They are best kept with other cichlids from Lake Malawi that can tolerate their territorial
behavior. Avoid housing them with very peaceful or small species that may become targets of aggression. A well-planned
tank with sufficient hiding spots can help mitigate aggressive interactions.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pseudotropheus zebra_ in captivity is achievable with the right setup. They are maternal mouthbrooders,
meaning the female carries the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, provide a
well-structured tank with plenty of hiding places and maintain a temperature around 26-28°C. After spawning, the female
will carry the eggs for about 21-28 days before releasing the fry. The fry can be fed finely crushed flake food or
specialized fry food once they are free-swimming.
