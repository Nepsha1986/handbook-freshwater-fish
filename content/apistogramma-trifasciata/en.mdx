## Overview

_Apistogramma trifasciata_ is a dwarf cichlid from the family Cichlidae, inhabiting slow-moving waters in the Paraguay
and Parana river basins in South America. In the wild, these fish are found in shallow flooded areas with dense
vegetation and accumulations of fallen leaves.

The species gets its name from three distinctive dark horizontal stripes clearly visible in both sexes, but especially
contrasting in males. Males of _A. trifasciata_ reach up to 6 cm, while females are smaller at around 4 cm. Male
coloration is impressive: the body ranges from bluish-grey to golden, with vivid blue and reddish hues on the fins.
Females are more subdued in everyday coloring but develop a striking yellow and black pattern during spawning. Lifespan
is 3–5 years.

This is one of the most commonly kept [Apistogramma](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides) species in the hobby, valued for its
attractive appearance and fascinating behavior.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or small group of _Apistogramma trifasciata_ requires a tank of at least 70 liters. Optimal water parameters are:
temperature 24–28 °C, pH 5.5–7.0, and general hardness (GH) 2–12. The fish display their brightest colors and most
active behavior in soft, slightly acidic water.

Use fine, dark substrate — sand or small gravel. Create plenty of hiding spots: ceramic caves, coconut shells,
driftwood, and rocks. Each female should have access to her own shelter — this reduces intraspecific aggression. Dense
vegetation and floating plants will create diffused lighting similar to their natural conditions.

Indian almond or oak leaves on the bottom will give the water a light amber tint and release beneficial tannins that
promote fish well-being. Water flow should be minimal — a sponge filter is ideal for this type of setup.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apistogramma trifasciata_ is a micro-predator that feeds on small invertebrates in the wild. In the aquarium, the core
diet should consist of live and frozen foods: bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, cyclops, and mosquito larvae. These
foods best enhance color vibrancy, particularly in males.

High-quality sinking granules for dwarf cichlids can supplement the main diet but should not be the sole food source.
Feed small portions twice daily — these fish prefer food that sinks slowly toward the bottom.

When preparing for breeding, increase the frequency and variety of live foods — this serves as a powerful spawning
trigger.

## Care and Maintenance

_Apistogramma trifasciata_ requires stable water parameters and regular tank maintenance. Weekly water changes of 20–25%
will help maintain water quality. Use test kits to monitor ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels — nitrates should
ideally be kept below 20 mg/l.

Filtration should be gentle, without creating strong currents. A sponge filter provides excellent biological filtration
and is safe for fry if the fish breed. Vacuum the substrate carefully, avoiding disruption of established territories
and shelters.

Pay attention to fish behavior: healthy _A. trifasciata_ actively explore the lower level of the tank and display
vibrant coloration. Fading colors, lethargy, or refusal to eat are signals of possible water quality issues or illness.

## Compatibility

_Apistogramma trifasciata_ coexists well with small, peaceful species that prefer the middle and upper water layers.
Suitable tank mates include [neon tetras](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [glowlight tetras](/en/hemigrammus-erythrozonus),
[harlequin rasboras](/en/trigonostigma-heteromorpha), and small catfish such as [panda corydoras](/en/corydoras-panda)
or [pygmy corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus).

Keeping them with other Apistogramma species in small tanks is not advisable — territorial skirmishes are inevitable,
especially during breeding. In larger aquariums (120 liters or more) with ample hiding spots, cohabitation with
[Apistogramma borellii](/en/apistogramma-borellii) may work provided territories are well separated.

Large or highly active fish are a poor choice for cohabitation, as they can intimidate the cichlids and cause chronic
stress.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma trifasciata_ is achievable in a home aquarium and makes for a fascinating experience. They are
cave spawners: the female deposits up to 100 eggs on the ceiling or walls of a shelter — a ceramic cave, coconut shell,
or narrow crevice between rocks.

To trigger spawning, soften the water to GH 2–5 and lower the pH to 5.5–6.5. A slight temperature drop of 1–2 °C during
a water change combined with generous live food offerings typically initiates breeding behavior.

After egg laying, the female assumes full care of the clutch, developing a vivid yellow coloration with contrasting
black markings. The male guards the outer boundaries of the territory. Eggs hatch in 2–3 days, and the fry become
free-swimming 5–6 days after hatching.

First foods include baby brine shrimp (artemia nauplii) and microworms. The female actively tends to the fry for several
weeks, guiding the school and defending against any threats. During this period, it is best not to interfere or disturb
the family group.
