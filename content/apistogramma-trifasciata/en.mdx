## Overview

**Apistogramma trifasciata**, commonly known as the Three-Striped Dwarf Cichlid, is a small and vibrant species of
cichlid native to South America. It can be found in slow-moving waters in the basins of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers.
This species is well known for its bright colors and distinct black horizontal stripes that run along its body,
especially prominent in males.

Males are typically larger, reaching 6 cm in length, while females stay closer to 4 cm. They are popular in the aquarium
hobby for their stunning appearance, but they require specific conditions to thrive.

## Tank Requirements

A tank size of at least 70 liters is recommended to house **Apistogramma trifasciata**. The water should be kept at a
temperature between 24-28°C with a pH of 5.5-7.0 and general hardness (GH) between 2-12 dGH.

They prefer well-planted tanks with lots of hiding spots like caves, driftwood, and rocks. These cichlids are
territorial, especially during breeding, so it is essential to provide plenty of visual barriers and territories within
the tank to prevent aggression.

## Feeding and Diet

**Apistogramma trifasciata** are carnivores by nature and thrive on a diet of live or frozen foods such as bloodworms,
brine shrimp, daphnia, and insect larvae. They may also accept high-quality sinking pellets or granules formulated for
dwarf cichlids.

Variety is key to keeping them healthy, and offering a mix of live and prepared foods will encourage vibrant coloration,
especially in males.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is moderately challenging to care for due to its specific water parameters and territorial behavior.
Regular water changes and maintenance of stable water conditions are essential to their health.

A well-maintained tank with soft, slightly acidic water will keep **Apistogramma trifasciata** thriving. Due to their
sensitivity, it's recommended to monitor ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels closely.

## Compatibility

**Apistogramma trifasciata** can coexist with other peaceful species but can become territorial during breeding,
particularly towards other cichlids. Tank mates should include small, peaceful fish such as tetras, rasboras, or small
catfish species like Corydoras.

Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish that may bully or outcompete them for territory.

## Breeding

Breeding **Apistogramma trifasciata** can be rewarding, but they require soft, slightly acidic water to trigger
spawning. The males will establish territories, and females will guard the eggs and fry after spawning. Providing caves
or hiding spots is crucial for successful breeding.

Females can lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch in 2-3 days. The fry become free-swimming after 5-6 days and can be fed
infusoria or baby brine shrimp.
