## Overview

**Aplocheilus lineatus**, commonly referred to as the Lampeye, is a small freshwater fish native to the slow-moving
waters of West Africa. These fish are recognized for their distinctive iridescent eyes that reflect light, creating a
shimmering effect. Males typically grow to about 5-7 cm in length, while females are slightly larger. Their lifespan
ranges from 3 to 5 years.

Lampeyes are peaceful and social fish, making them excellent additions to community tanks. They exhibit interesting
schooling behavior and are best kept in groups.

## Tank Requirements

**Aplocheilus lineatus** thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water conditions with a pH range of 6.5 to 8.0 and a
general hardness (GH) of 5-20 dGH. The ideal temperature range is between 22-28°C, and they should be housed in a tank
with a minimum volume of 60 liters.

Providing a well-planted aquarium with open swimming areas is essential for their well-being. They appreciate a variety
of hiding spots and will thrive in tanks with floating plants that diffuse light.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Aplocheilus lineatus** primarily feed on small invertebrates and zooplankton. In captivity, they accept a
variety of foods, including high-quality flakes, small pellets, and live or frozen foods like brine shrimp and daphnia.

To maintain their health and vibrant colors, offer a balanced diet that includes both protein-rich foods and plant
matter. Feed small portions 2-3 times a day, ensuring they consume all food within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

Lampeyes are relatively easy to care for but are sensitive to poor water quality. Regular water changes of 20-30% each
week are essential for maintaining a healthy environment. A reliable filtration system is necessary to keep the water
clean and well-oxygenated.

These fish enjoy the company of their own kind and should be kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals. A larger group
will help them feel secure and reduce stress.

## Compatibility

**Aplocheilus lineatus** are generally peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish. Suitable
tankmates include tetras, rasboras, and other small livebearers. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive species,
as they may become stressed or bullied.

Providing plenty of hiding spots and open swimming areas will help maintain a peaceful environment for these active and
social fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Aplocheilus lineatus** is relatively straightforward. To encourage breeding, provide ample plants where
females can hide and lay eggs.

The female will lay eggs on plants, and the eggs will typically hatch within 7-10 days. Once the fry are free-swimming,
they can be fed with finely crushed flakes or specialized fry food. It’s essential to separate the fry from adult fish
to prevent them from being eaten.
