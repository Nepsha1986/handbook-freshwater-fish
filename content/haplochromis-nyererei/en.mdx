## Overview

Haplochromis nyererei, commonly known as the Flameback Cichlid, is a stunning freshwater fish native to Lake Victoria in
East Africa. This species is renowned for its striking coloration, with males displaying vibrant red, yellow, and blue
hues, while females are more subdued in appearance. These fish are prized by aquarists for their beauty and energetic
behavior, making them a focal point in any aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 120 liters is suitable for a group of Haplochromis nyererei. They thrive in warm water temperatures
ranging from 24-28Â°C, with a pH between 7.5 and 8.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 8-15. Decorate the tank with rocks
and caves to mimic their natural rocky habitat while providing open swimming areas. Sand or fine gravel is recommended
as a substrate.

## Feeding and Diet

Flameback Cichlids are omnivores, feeding on small invertebrates and algae in their natural habitat. In an aquarium,
they should be offered a varied diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with frozen or live foods like brine
shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Avoid overfeeding and provide occasional spirulina-based foods to support their vibrant
colors.

## Care and Maintenance

Haplochromis nyererei requires moderate care, as they are sensitive to poor water conditions. Perform weekly water
changes of 20-30% and maintain stable water parameters. Proper filtration and aeration are essential to mimic their
oxygen-rich natural habitat. These fish are active and territorial, so ensure sufficient space and hiding spots to
reduce stress and aggression.

## Compatibility

Flameback Cichlids are territorial, especially males, and may show aggression toward conspecifics or other similar-sized
fish. They are best kept in species-specific tanks or with other robust, similarly sized cichlids from Lake Victoria.
Avoid housing them with timid or smaller species that may be harassed.

## Breeding

Breeding Haplochromis nyererei in captivity is achievable with the right conditions. They are maternal mouthbrooders,
with females incubating eggs and fry in their mouths for 2-3 weeks. A harem setup with one male and multiple females
works best to minimize aggression. Provide flat surfaces or caves for spawning and ensure a separate rearing tank for
fry once released.
