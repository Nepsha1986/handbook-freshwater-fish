## Overview

**Exodon paradoxus**, commonly known as the _Bucktooth Tetra_, is a fascinating but challenging species to keep in home
aquariums. This tetra is notorious for its aggressive, biting behavior, making it unsuitable for community tanks with
peaceful fish. Its vibrant, silver body with reddish fins and unique markings make it a striking addition to a
species-only tank.

## Tank Requirements

The Bucktooth Tetra requires a tank of at least 150 liters to allow a proper swimming space for a group of 8 or more
individuals. They thrive in water with a temperature of 22–28°C, a pH between 6.5 and 7.5, and a general hardness of
5–15 dGH. A well-planted tank with open swimming areas, subdued lighting, and robust filtration is ideal for this active
and messy species.

## Feeding and Diet

Exodon paradoxus is a carnivorous fish that feeds on insects, crustaceans, and small fish in the wild. In captivity,
they readily accept high-quality pellets, flakes, frozen foods, and live prey. Ensure their diet includes protein-rich
options like bloodworms, brine shrimp, or small fish to keep them healthy and active.

## Care and Maintenance

These tetras require careful attention to water quality, as they are sensitive to poor conditions. Weekly water changes
and a strong filtration system are necessary to maintain a clean and stable environment. Their biting behavior and
territorial nature mean they should be kept in a species-only tank to avoid harming other fish.

## Compatibility

The Bucktooth Tetra is best kept in a group of its own kind. This reduces aggression between individuals and prevents
them from attacking tankmates. Avoid housing them with peaceful or smaller fish, as they will bite and harass any fish
they perceive as prey.

## Breeding

Breeding Exodon paradoxus in captivity is rare but possible. They are egg scatterers that require a separate breeding
tank with fine-leafed plants or a spawning mat. Conditioning the pair with live and protein-rich foods can encourage
spawning. Remove the adults after eggs are laid to prevent them from eating the eggs.
