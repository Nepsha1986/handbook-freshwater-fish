## Overview

**Symphysodon discus**, commonly known as the Discus fish, is a stunning freshwater species native to the Amazon River
basin in South America. They are highly regarded for their unique round shape and vibrant colors, making them one of the
most popular and sought-after fish among aquarists.

Discus fish typically grow to a size of 15 to 20 cm and can live for 10 to 15 years with proper care. They are known for
their peaceful nature but require stable water conditions and a well-maintained environment to thrive.

## Tank Requirements

A spacious tank of at least 300 liters is essential for keeping **Symphysodon discus**. They thrive in warmer water
temperatures ranging from 26 to 30°C. The general hardness (GH) should be kept between 1-10 dGH, and the pH level should
be maintained between 5.5 and 7.5.

To create a suitable environment, provide plenty of plants, driftwood, and open swimming areas. Discus prefer a
well-planted aquarium with subdued lighting and soft, slightly acidic water conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

**Symphysodon discus** are omnivores and require a varied diet to maintain their health and vibrant coloration. In
captivity, they should be fed high-quality pellets or flakes designed for discus, as well as frozen or live foods such
as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and beef heart.

A balanced diet will help support their growth and overall health, and it’s recommended to feed them multiple times a
day in small portions.

## Care and Maintenance

Discus fish require a higher level of care compared to other freshwater species. Regular water changes of 25-50% per
week are essential to maintain water quality and prevent disease. They are sensitive to poor water conditions, so it’s
crucial to monitor ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels closely.

Discus are social fish and should be kept in groups of at least 5-6 individuals to reduce stress and encourage natural
behaviors. However, ensure a proper male-to-female ratio to minimize aggression during breeding.

## Compatibility

**Symphysodon discus** are generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They can be kept with
other peaceful species, such as tetras, rasboras, and smaller cichlids. Avoid aggressive or fin-nipping species that may
stress them.

To ensure a harmonious community tank, it’s essential to provide plenty of hiding spots and open swimming areas.

## Breeding

Breeding **Symphysodon discus** can be challenging and requires optimal water conditions and a well-planned setup. They
form monogamous pairs during breeding and will lay eggs on flat surfaces, such as leaves or flat rocks.

After the eggs hatch, the parents will care for the fry, providing them with a protective environment. For successful
breeding, a separate breeding tank is often recommended to prevent stress from tank mates.
