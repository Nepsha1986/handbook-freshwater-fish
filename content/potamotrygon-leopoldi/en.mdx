## Overview

**Potamotrygon leopoldi**, commonly known as **Leopold's River Stingray** or **Leopold's Stingray**, is a captivating
freshwater ray native to South American rivers. It is distinguished by its unique and intricate pattern, which varies
among individuals, typically featuring dark spots and a light background. Growing up to 30-50 cm in diameter, this
species is known for its gentle disposition, though it requires a large tank and specific care to thrive in captivity.

## Tank Requirements

**Potamotrygon leopoldi** requires a spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 500 liters to accommodate its size and
to provide ample swimming space. The water temperature should be kept between 24-28Â°C, with a pH level ranging from 6.5
to 7.5 and water hardness (GH) between 3-10. A soft substrate, such as sand, is ideal to protect its delicate underside,
and the tank should be well-filtered to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Leopold's River Stingray** feeds on a diet of small fish, crustaceans, and insects. In captivity, it can
be provided with a varied diet of high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods like shrimp, worms, and small fish. It's
important to offer a balanced diet and to feed them regularly to maintain their health. Care should be taken not to
overfeed, as excessive waste can affect water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Proper care for **Potamotrygon leopoldi** involves maintaining pristine water conditions. Perform regular water changes
of 20-30% weekly to ensure a clean environment. Monitor water parameters closely to prevent fluctuations that can stress
the ray. The tank should be equipped with a powerful filtration system to handle the high bioload. Ensure the substrate
is soft and smooth to prevent injury to the ray's underside.

## Compatibility

**Potamotrygon leopoldi** is generally peaceful and can be kept with other large, non-aggressive fish species. Suitable
tank mates include other rays, large catfish, and robust freshwater fish. Avoid housing them with smaller or overly
aggressive species, as they may become stressed or injured. Providing ample space and hiding spots can help reduce
potential conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding **Potamotrygon leopoldi** in captivity can be challenging and requires specific conditions. Successful breeding
usually involves maintaining a stable environment with ideal water conditions and a well-balanced diet. The rays are
viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Once pregnant, the female carries the
developing embryos until they are ready to be born. Proper care of the young rays involves ensuring they have a suitable
environment and appropriate food to support their growth.
