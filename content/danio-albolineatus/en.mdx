## Overview

Danio albolineatus, commonly known as Pearl Danio, is a small, peaceful freshwater fish originating from Southeast Asia.
The fish is named for its pearl-like iridescence and features a slender body with a shimmering stripe along its side. It
thrives in groups and is known for its active swimming behavior, making it a popular choice for community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Danio albolineatus requires a tank of at least 60 liters. They prefer a water temperature between 22-27°C, with a pH
range of 6.5-7.5 and a general hardness (dGH) of 5-12. A well-planted aquarium with plenty of swimming space is ideal.
Moderate water flow and a good filtration system help maintain water quality for this active species.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Pearl Danios feed on small insects, crustaceans, and other tiny aquatic organisms. In an
aquarium, they are not picky eaters and can be fed a variety of foods including high-quality flakes, micro pellets, and
occasional live or frozen foods like daphnia or bloodworms. Providing a balanced diet will keep them healthy and enhance
their coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Danio albolineatus is an easy species to care for, making it suitable for both novice and experienced aquarists. They
are hardy and can tolerate a range of water conditions, but regular water changes and tank cleaning are important to
keep them healthy. Monitoring water parameters and keeping the tank well-maintained ensures a long and healthy life for
this fish.

## Compatibility

Pearl Danios are peaceful and get along well with other non-aggressive species, making them perfect for community tanks.
Suitable tank mates include tetras, rasboras, and other danios. It’s recommended to keep them in groups of at least 6 to
reduce stress and promote natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Danio albolineatus is relatively easy. They are egg scatterers and will readily breed in a well-maintained
aquarium. To increase the chances of successful breeding, set up a breeding tank with fine-leaved plants or a spawning
mop to catch the eggs. After spawning, it’s important to remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The
eggs will hatch in 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food.
