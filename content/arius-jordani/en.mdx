## Overview

**Arius jordani**, also known as Jordan's Catfish, Colombian Shark, or Silvertip Shark, is a brackish water catfish
native to the estuaries and coastal rivers of Central and South America. Recognized for its elongated body and forked
tail, this species can reach sizes of up to 30-60 cm (12-24 inches) in captivity. It is a popular species among
aquarists who can provide the specialized conditions needed to accommodate its size and brackish water requirements.

## Tank Requirements

Arius jordani thrives in large aquariums with plenty of swimming space and a good amount of water flow to simulate its
natural habitat. A tank size of at least 250 liters (65 gallons) is recommended, though larger tanks are preferable as
the fish grows. The water temperature should be maintained between 24-28°C (75-82°F) with a pH of 7.0 to 8.5 and general
hardness (GH) of 10-25. Since it is a brackish water species, the addition of marine salt to achieve the correct
salinity is essential. The tank should be well-aerated with a strong filtration system to handle the bioload of these
large, active fish.

## Feeding and Diet

Jordan's Catfish is omnivorous, with a diet that includes small fish, invertebrates, and plant matter in the wild. In an
aquarium setting, they should be offered a varied diet consisting of high-quality pellets or flakes, supplemented with
live or frozen foods such as shrimp, fish, and worms. They may also consume algae wafers and vegetables like zucchini or
spinach. A diverse diet will help maintain their health and vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Due to their size and brackish water needs, Arius jordani requires a commitment to maintenance. Regular water changes
are necessary to keep the water parameters stable and to prevent the buildup of toxins. Their large size and active
nature mean they produce a considerable amount of waste, so a robust filtration system is crucial. It's also important
to monitor the salinity levels to ensure they are within the appropriate range for brackish water.

## Compatibility

Arius jordani can be kept with other large, brackish water species that are not easily intimidated and can hold their
own against this active fish. Suitable tank mates include other brackish water catfish, large tetras, and other
similarly sized, peaceful fish. Avoid keeping them with small or slow-moving species that may be seen as prey. They are
generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially in smaller tanks.

## Breeding

Breeding Arius jordani in captivity is challenging due to their size and brackish water requirements. They are
mouthbrooders, with the male holding the fertilized eggs in his mouth until they hatch. Providing a suitable environment
with hiding places and the correct water parameters is essential, but successful breeding in home aquariums is rare.
Professional aquarists or breeders with extensive experience are more likely to achieve breeding success.
