## Overview

Jordan's Catfish (_Arius jordani_) is an impressive freshwater-to-brackish catfish from the Ariidae family, also known
as the "Colombian Shark" due to its characteristic silhouette resembling a marine shark. In the wild, it inhabits
estuaries, mangrove areas, and coastal rivers of Central and South America, where it occurs in both fresh and brackish
water.

Adults reach substantial sizes of 30–60 cm, making this one of the larger species in the aquarium hobby. The body is
elongated and streamlined, silver in color with distinctive white tips on the fins — hence the name "Silvertip Shark."
The caudal fin is deeply forked, and long barbels help the fish navigate murky waters. Lifespan is 8–12 years.

_Arius jordani_ is primarily a nocturnal species. During the day, the fish prefers shelter, becoming more active at dusk
and through the night. Despite its peaceful nature, this is a schooling fish best kept in groups of at least 3 —
solitary individuals tend to become shy and stress-prone.

### How to Distinguish Males from Females?

Sexual dimorphism is subtle. Males are generally somewhat slimmer than females. The most obvious difference appears
during spawning: males carry eggs in their mouths, making them easily identifiable during this period.

## Tank Requirements

Given the size and activity level of _Arius jordani_, an aquarium of at least **250 liters** is required, with 400
liters or more preferred as the fish grow. The tank should be elongated with ample open swimming space.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature**: 24–28°C
- **pH**: 7.0–8.5
- **Hardness (dGH)**: 10–25
- **Salinity**: addition of marine salt (5–15 g/L) is recommended to create brackish conditions

Use large rocks, driftwood, and ceramic caves for decoration — the fish need shelters for daytime rest. Sandy substrate
is preferred, as the catfish sift through it while foraging. Only salt-tolerant live plants are suitable (Java moss,
Anubias). Powerful filtration and strong aeration are essential — these fish are sensitive to water quality and require
high oxygen levels. A tight-fitting lid is mandatory — _Arius jordani_ can jump.

## Feeding and Diet

_Arius jordani_ is an omnivorous predator with a strong preference for protein-rich foods. The aquarium diet should
include:

- Large sinking pellets for predatory catfish (staple diet)
- Frozen foods: shrimp, mussels, fish fillet pieces, bloodworms
- Live foods: small fish, earthworms, large brine shrimp
- Vegetable supplements: blanched zucchini, spinach, spirulina tablets

Feed once daily, preferably in the evening when the fish are most active. Juveniles should be fed twice daily. Avoid
overfeeding — at their large size, these catfish produce considerable waste, which rapidly degrades water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Keeping _Arius jordani_ requires moderate experience and a diligent approach to tank maintenance:

- **Water changes**: 25–30% weekly, with careful salinity matching of replacement water
- **Filtration**: a powerful external filter rated for 1.5–2 times the actual tank volume
- **Aeration**: essential, preferably using an air pump with diffusers
- **Salinity monitoring**: use a hydrometer or refractometer for accurate measurements

Regularly test water parameters — ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. Large catfish produce substantial waste, so
biological filtration must be mature and efficient. Vacuum the substrate during each water change, paying special
attention to areas around shelters.

## Compatibility

_Arius jordani_ is a peaceful but large species that may accidentally swallow small tank mates. Suitable companions
include:

- [Monodactylus](/en/monodactylus-argenteus) — a classic companion for brackish aquariums
- [Scatophagus](/en/scatophagus-argus) — another hardy brackish-water inhabitant
- [Archerfish](/en/toxotes-jaculatrix) — an active companion for the upper water layers
- Other large brackish-water species

Avoid keeping them with small fish (under 8–10 cm) that may be seen as prey. Also avoid aggressive territorial species
that could damage the catfish's long barbels. [Bumblebee gobies](/en/brachygobius-doriae) and other small bottom
dwellers are unsuitable tank mates.

Within their school, _Arius jordani_ establish a mild hierarchy, but serious conflicts rarely occur when adequate space
is provided.

## Breeding

Breeding _Arius jordani_ in home aquariums is extremely challenging, with successful cases being rare. The key feature
of this species is **mouthbrooding**: after fertilization, the male takes the eggs into his mouth and incubates them for
several weeks, completely refusing food during this period.

For a breeding attempt, the following is needed:

- A spacious aquarium of at least 500 liters with shelters
- Stable water parameters with correct salinity
- A group of 5–6 adults for natural pair formation
- Intensified live food feeding for several weeks beforehand

Fry emerging from the male's mouth are already relatively large and can feed on baby brine shrimp and fine frozen foods.
However, achieving spawning in aquarium conditions is extremely rare, and most specimens available in the trade are
wild-caught.
