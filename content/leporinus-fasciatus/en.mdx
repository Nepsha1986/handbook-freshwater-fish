## Overview

**Leporinus fasciatus**, commonly known as the Banded Leporinus, is a beautifully striped freshwater fish from the
Anostomidae family. Found in rivers and streams across South America, these fish are known for their distinctive black
and yellow bands and elongated bodies.

Banded Leporinus can grow to a size of 15-30 cm and have a lifespan of 5-10 years when kept in optimal conditions. They
are a relatively large species that require a spacious tank and are recommended for intermediate to advanced aquarists
due to their size and care needs.

## Tank Requirements

Leporinus fasciatus thrive in temperatures between 23-28°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.5 and water hardness between 5-15
GH. Due to their size and active nature, they require a minimum tank size of 200 liters, although larger tanks are
preferable.

These fish prefer tanks with plenty of swimming space, driftwood, and some sturdy plants. However, they have a tendency
to nibble on vegetation, so it’s important to choose robust plant species or use artificial plants.

## Feeding and Diet

**Leporinus fasciatus** are omnivores with a preference for both plant matter and protein-rich foods. They will accept a
varied diet of high-quality flakes or pellets, supplemented with vegetables like spinach, peas, or zucchini, as well as
live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.

Offering a balanced diet with both plant and protein sources is essential for their health.

## Care and Maintenance

Due to their larger size, **Leporinus fasciatus** need regular maintenance to keep their tank environment clean and
stable. Weekly water changes and a powerful filtration system are recommended, as these fish can be messy eaters and
produce significant waste.

Their temperament can be semi-aggressive, especially toward smaller or slower fish, so it’s important to provide ample
hiding spaces and monitor their behavior closely.

## Compatibility

Banded Leporinus can be kept in community tanks with similarly sized, fast-moving species. They may display aggressive
tendencies toward smaller tankmates or fish with long fins. Suitable companions include larger tetras, cichlids, and
robust catfish species. Avoid keeping them with very small fish, as they may see them as prey.

## Breeding

Breeding **Leporinus fasciatus** in home aquariums is quite rare and challenging due to their size and specific
environmental requirements. In the wild, they breed in large rivers during seasonal flooding. Captive breeding usually
requires a very large, specialized tank and carefully controlled water parameters.
