## Overview

The Longfin Bristlenose Catfish (_Ancistrus dolichopterus_), also known as the Veiltail Bristlenose or Longfin
Ancistrus, is one of the most decorative members of the Ancistrus genus from the armored catfish family (Loricariidae).
Native to rivers and tributaries of South America, primarily the Amazon basin, this species captivates aquarists with
its unusual elongated fins resembling a veil or dragonfly wings.

The main distinguishing feature of _Ancistrus dolichopterus_ is its magnificent finnage — the dorsal and caudal fins are
significantly elongated, creating a "veil" effect that is especially noticeable when the fish moves. The body is dark
brown or black with a scattering of light spots forming a characteristic starry pattern. Like all bristlenose catfish,
the body is covered with bony plates providing protection.

Adults reach a size of 12-15 cm, making this species one of the larger popular bristlenose catfish. Lifespan with proper
care is an impressive 10-15 years. Sexual dimorphism is clearly expressed: males possess characteristic fleshy growths
(tentacles) on their heads, which are absent or minimally expressed in females.

The Longfin Bristlenose is primarily nocturnal, becoming active at dusk and during the night. During the day, it prefers
hiding in shelters, emerging to feed after lights go out. This catfish is an excellent algae-fighting helper, actively
scraping algae from decorations, glass, and plants.

## Tank Requirements

For comfortable keeping of the Longfin Bristlenose Catfish (_Ancistrus dolichopterus_), conditions must be created that
account for its size and behavioral characteristics. Given the long fins, this species requires more space for free
movement.

- **Tank Volume:** The minimum volume for a single specimen is 100 liters. For a pair or small group, an aquarium of
  150-200 liters is recommended. A spacious tank allows the fish to display the full beauty of its fins and reduces the
  risk of fin damage.

- **Water Temperature:** The optimal range is 22-26°C. This species prefers slightly cooler water compared to other
  tropical fish, making it a good choice for unheated aquariums in warm rooms.

- **Water Parameters:**

  - **pH:** 6.0-7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral)
  - **General Hardness (GH):** 6-15 dGH (soft to moderately hard)
  - **Ammonia, Nitrites:** 0 ppm
  - **Nitrates:** <20 ppm Regular water testing is critically important for this species' health.

- **Lighting:** As a nocturnal species, the Longfin Bristlenose prefers subdued lighting. Creating shaded zones using
  floating plants or dense vegetation is recommended.

- **Tank Setup:**

  - **Substrate:** Use soft substrate — sand or fine rounded gravel to avoid damaging the fish's delicate fins and
    barbels.
  - **Hiding Spots:** Multiple hiding places are essential: driftwood, ceramic tubes, rock caves. Driftwood is
    especially important — it serves as a source of cellulose necessary for digestion.
  - **Plants:** Live plants are welcome. Choose hard-leaved species (Anubias, Cryptocorynes, ferns) as soft leaves may
    be eaten.
  - **Swimming Space:** Leave enough open space for the fish to freely spread its magnificent fins.

- **Water Flow:** Moderate current mimicking river conditions. Good aeration is mandatory.

## Feeding and Diet

The Longfin Bristlenose is primarily herbivorous, with plant matter forming the basis of its diet. Balanced nutrition is
key to vibrant coloration and healthy fins.

- **Main Diet:**

  - **Specialized Foods:** Sinking tablets and wafers for catfish with high spirulina content. Choose quality foods from
    reputable manufacturers.
  - **Natural Algae:** Bristlenose catfish actively consume algae growth in the aquarium. This is their natural food,
    and a small amount of algae in the tank is actually beneficial.
  - **Vegetables:** Regularly offer fresh vegetables:
    - **Zucchini, cucumbers:** Slice into rounds, blanch with boiling water, and secure at the bottom.
    - **Spinach, lettuce leaves:** Blanch before serving.
    - **Pumpkin, carrots:** Boil until soft and cut into small pieces.
  - **Driftwood:** An essential element — bristlenose catfish scrape cellulose from it, necessary for proper digestion.

- **Supplemental Feeding:**

  - **Protein Supplements:** 1-2 times weekly, frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, or daphnia can be offered. Protein is
    especially important for breeders during spawning preparation.
  - **Live Foods:** Occasionally live food can be given, ensuring its quality.

- **Feeding Schedule:** Feed once daily, preferably in the evening or after lights out when the fish is most active.
  Remove uneaten vegetables after 12-24 hours.

**Important:** Avoid overfeeding. Uneaten food quickly pollutes water and can lead to health problems.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Longfin Bristlenose isn't difficult but requires attention to several key aspects, especially those
related to its long fins.

- **Regular Water Changes:** Weekly water changes of 20-30% of tank volume with fresh, dechlorinated water are
  necessary. This is critically important for maintaining water quality and fin health.

- **Filtration:** Use a powerful filtration system with good mechanical and biological cleaning. An external canister
  filter is the optimal choice for larger aquariums.

- **Aeration:** Ensure good water oxygenation. Use an air pump or direct filter flow at the water surface.

- **Fin Care:** Long fins are the main feature and vulnerable point of this species:

  - Avoid sharp decorations that could damage the fish's fins.
  - Monitor water quality — high nitrate levels can cause fin deterioration.
  - At the first signs of fin rot, immediately improve water quality and begin treatment if necessary.

- **Health Monitoring:** Daily inspect your fish. A healthy Longfin Bristlenose has intact, spread fins, vibrant
  coloration, and is active at night.

- **Substrate Cleaning:** Regularly siphon the substrate to remove organic waste.

## Compatibility

The Longfin Bristlenose is a peaceful catfish that gets along excellently with most peaceful aquarium fish. However, its
long fins require special attention when selecting tankmates.

- **Ideal Tankmates:**

  - **Peaceful Characins:** [Neons](/en/paracheirodon-innesi), [tetras](/en/hyphessobrycon-herbertaxelrodi), rummy-nose
    tetras.
  - **Rasboras:** [Harlequin rasbora](/en/trigonostigma-heteromorpha), [celestial pearl danio](/en/danio-margaritatus).
  - **Livebearers:** Guppies, platies, mollies (with compatible water parameters).
  - **Peaceful Cichlids:** [Angelfish](/en/pterophyllum-scalare), Apistogrammas.
  - **Other Catfish:** [Corydoras](/en/corydoras-aeneus), otocinclus.
  - **Labyrinth Fish:** Peaceful gouramis, dwarf gouramis.

- **Unsuitable Tankmates:**

  - **Fin-nipping Fish:** Tiger barbs, serpae tetras, and other species prone to nipping long fins.
  - **Aggressive Cichlids:** Large and territorial species that may attack the bristlenose.
  - **Very Active Fish:** Overly energetic tankmates can create stress for the relatively slow-moving Longfin
    Bristlenose.

- **Intraspecies Compatibility:**
  - Males may show territoriality, especially during spawning season.
  - It's recommended to keep one male with several females or provide sufficient hiding spots for each individual.

## Breeding

Breeding the Longfin Bristlenose in home aquariums is quite achievable with proper conditions. They are cave spawners
with pronounced paternal care.

- **Spawning Preparation:**

  - **Breeding Tank:** A separate tank of at least 60 liters with multiple hiding spots. Ceramic or plastic tubes are
    ideal spawning substrates.
  - **Water Parameters:** Stimulate spawning with frequent water changes (30-40% every 2-3 days) using softer, cooler
    water. Raise temperature to 26-28°C.
  - **Breeder Conditioning:** 2-3 weeks before spawning, enrich the diet with protein foods — bloodworms, brine shrimp,
    shrimp.

- **Spawning Process:**

  - The male selects and cleans a shelter, then actively courts the female.
  - The female deposits 50-200 large orange eggs on the shelter walls.
  - After egg-laying, the female is chased away, and all care is taken over by the male.
  - The male guards the clutch, fans it with his fins, and removes dead eggs.

- **Fry Care:**
  - Incubation lasts 4-6 days at 26-28°C.
  - Larvae feed on their yolk sac for 3-5 days, remaining under the male's protection.
  - After the fry become free-swimming, the male can be removed.
  - **First Foods:** Finely crushed spirulina tablets, specialized catfish fry foods, blanched vegetables.
  - Maintain ideal water cleanliness — daily water changes of 10-15%.

Fry grow relatively quickly, reaching 2-3 cm by 2-3 months. The characteristic elongated fins begin to develop with age.
