## Overview

The Longfin Bristlenose Catfish, also known as _Ancistrus dolichopterus_, is a captivating freshwater fish native to
South America. Recognized for its distinctive appearance, this species features long, flowing fins and a bristly body.
It's a member of the Loricariidae family, known for its algae-eating habits. The Starlight Bristlenose is a peaceful and
hardy fish, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced aquarium enthusiasts. Its unique look and
manageable care requirements make it a standout addition to any freshwater aquarium.

Like most members of the Ancistrus family, male Starlight Bristlenose have distinctive growths on their heads, making
them easily recognizable.

## Tank Requirements

Longfin Bristlenose Catfish thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. They prefer a
temperature range of 72-78°F (22-26°C) and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a substrate of sand or
fine gravel and include plenty of hiding spots, such as driftwood and rocks, to provide shelter and replicate their
natural environment. A good filtration system is important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of
20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Ancistrus dolichopterus_ is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and plant matter in the wild. In captivity, they
can be fed a diet of high-quality algae wafers, sinking pellets, and fresh vegetables such as cucumber and zucchini.
They may also appreciate occasional protein sources like live or frozen foods. Providing a varied diet will help
maintain their health and enhance their coloration. Feed them once or twice a day, with portions that suit their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Longfin Bristlenose Catfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They
are relatively easy to care for and make a great addition to community tanks due to their peaceful nature. Regular water
changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as algae blooms or fin
rot. Their algae-eating behavior helps keep the tank clean and reduces maintenance.

## Compatibility

_Ancistrus dolichopterus_ is a peaceful and non-aggressive species that can be kept with a variety of tank mates. They
are suitable for community tanks with other peaceful fish and can coexist with many species, including other catfish.
Avoid housing them with aggressive or very large fish that might outcompete them for food or cause stress. Providing
ample hiding spots and territories will help prevent any potential conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Ancistrus dolichopterus_ in captivity is relatively straightforward. They are cave-spawning fish, with the
male taking responsibility for guarding the eggs and fry. To encourage breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C
and provide a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots and caves. The female will lay eggs in a cave or
sheltered area, and the male will fertilize and protect them until they hatch. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can
be fed infusoria or finely crushed food. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy
fry.
