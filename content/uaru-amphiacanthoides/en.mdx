## Overview

Uaru amphiacanthoides, also known as the Triangle Cichlid, is a striking species of cichlid native to the slow-moving
rivers of the Amazon Basin. This large fish can grow up to 25-30 cm in length and is recognized by its distinct
triangular body shape, which gives it a unique appearance among cichlids. The Uaru Cichlid is generally peaceful, making
it a good choice for community tanks with other large, non-aggressive species. Its coloration changes as it matures,
starting with a mottled brown and eventually developing a more defined, dark band across its body.

## Tank Requirements

The Triangle Cichlid requires a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 300 liters to accommodate its size and active
nature. The ideal water temperature for this species ranges from 24-28°C, with a pH of 5.5-7.0 and general hardness (GH)
of 2-8. Soft, slightly acidic water conditions are preferred, replicating the natural habitat of the Amazon Basin. The
tank should be well-planted with hardy plants and include plenty of hiding spots created by driftwood, rocks, and caves.
A sandy substrate is recommended, as Uaru amphiacanthoides may dig around the tank. Efficient filtration is essential to
maintain water quality, along with regular water changes.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Uaru amphiacanthoides primarily feeds on plant material, including leaves and algae, as well as small
invertebrates. In captivity, their diet should consist of high-quality vegetable-based foods such as spirulina flakes,
algae wafers, and blanched vegetables like spinach and zucchini. They can also be given occasional protein-rich foods
such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, or insect larvae. Feeding should be done 1-2 times daily, ensuring any uneaten food is
removed to prevent water quality issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Uaru amphiacanthoides involves maintaining stable water parameters and ensuring a clean environment. Regular
water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary to keep the water pristine. Although generally peaceful, Uaru Cichlids can
become territorial during breeding periods, so it’s important to provide adequate space and hiding spots for other tank
inhabitants. Monitoring their health regularly is crucial, as they can be prone to diseases like hole-in-the-head if
water conditions are poor or their diet lacks essential nutrients.

## Compatibility

The Triangle Cichlid is a peaceful species that can be housed with other large, non-aggressive fish. Ideal tank mates
include other South American cichlids, large tetras, and peaceful catfish species. Avoid keeping them with very small
fish, as they may be mistaken for food. While generally non-aggressive, Uaru amphiacanthoides may become territorial
when spawning, so providing sufficient space and hiding spots for all tank members is essential to reduce stress and
aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Uaru amphiacanthoides in captivity can be challenging but is achievable with the right conditions. They are
biparental, meaning both the male and female will care for the eggs and fry. To encourage breeding, it’s important to
provide a large, well-planted tank with soft, acidic water and a temperature of around 26-28°C. The pair will usually
lay eggs on a flat surface, such as a rock or a piece of driftwood. After spawning, the parents will guard the eggs and
fry, fanning them to keep them clean and aerated. The fry should be fed with finely crushed vegetable-based foods and
infusoria. Successful breeding requires careful monitoring and maintenance of optimal water conditions.
