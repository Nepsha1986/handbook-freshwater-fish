## Overview

Ambastaia sidthimunki, known as the Dwarf Loach or Chain Loach, is a small, energetic species found in freshwater rivers
of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Myanmar. With its active behavior, social nature, and distinctive
pattern of dark chain-like stripes, this fish is popular among aquarium enthusiasts. Growing up to 6 cm in length, the
Dwarf Loach thrives in groups, where it can display its natural schooling behavior. It is peaceful and compatible with
other non-aggressive fish of similar size.

This is the only species in the genus Ambastaia that remains small (up to 6 cm). Other loach species are generally much
larger.

In the wild, the Dwarf Loach was considered extinct in its natural habitat in the 1980s due to habitat destruction.
However, small populations were discovered in the 1990s, and efforts to restore the species' numbers are ongoing.

The Dwarf Loach is an excellent choice for aquarium owners who want to keep active and friendly fish. With proper care
and conditions, these fish can thrive for many years.

## Aquarium Requirements

To comfortably house Dwarf Loaches, an aquarium with a capacity of at least 80 liters is recommended. It should contain
plenty of hiding spots made of rocks, driftwood, and plants, creating safe zones. Optimal water parameters are:

- **Temperature**: 24-28Â°C
- **pH**: 6.5-7.5
- **Hardness**: 5-15 dGH

Loaches prefer a soft sandy substrate that will not damage their sensitive whiskers. Moderate or strong water flow,
mimicking their natural environment, promotes their activity and well-being. It is important to use a tightly fitting
lid, as these fish tend to jump.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Ambastaia sidthimunki feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant matter. In the aquarium, their
diet should be varied and include:

- High-quality sinking pellets and tablets
- Frozen and live foods: bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia
- Plant-based supplements: blanched spinach, cucumber, zucchini

Feed the fish 1-2 times a day in small portions, ensuring a balanced diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Dwarf Loaches are sensitive to water quality, so regular aquarium maintenance is essential. Key tasks include:

- Replacing 20-30% of the water weekly
- Vacuuming the substrate with a siphon
- Monitoring water parameters with test kits
- Cleaning filters to maintain a stable environment

Maintaining a clean aquarium and stable conditions reduces stress for the fish and enhances their resistance to
diseases.

## Compatibility

Ambastaia sidthimunki is a social and peaceful species that prefers to live in groups of 5-6 individuals. They get along
well with small, peaceful fish such as:

- **Tetras**
- **Rasboras**
- **Other loaches**

Avoid housing them with large and aggressive species that may intimidate the loaches or outcompete them for food.

Like other loaches, A. sidthimunki can help control snail populations in the aquarium by actively hunting them.

## Breeding

Most Dwarf Loaches available for sale are bred on specialized farms using hormonal stimulation, as natural breeding in
home aquariums is almost impossible.

Breeding Dwarf Loaches in an aquarium is a challenging task, and successful cases are rare. In the wild, they spawn
during the rainy season in large groups. To attempt breeding, conditions close to their natural environment should be
recreated:

- A spacious, densely planted aquarium
- Moderately soft water
- Plenty of hiding spots

During spawning, males actively chase the females, and the eggs are laid on plants and substrate. If offspring are
successfully obtained, the fry should be fed microorganisms, infusoria, and specialized fry foods.
