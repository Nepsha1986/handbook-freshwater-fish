## Overview

Ambastaia sidthimunki, commonly known as the Dwarf Chain Loach, is a small and energetic species native to the
freshwater rivers of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Myanmar. This loach is well-loved in the aquarium
hobby for its active nature, social behavior, and attractive chain-like pattern on its body. Growing up to 6 cm in
length, they are best kept in groups, which allows them to display their natural schooling behavior. They are peaceful
and get along well with other similarly sized, non-aggressive fish.

## Tank Requirements

Dwarf Chain Loaches thrive in a well-planted aquarium of at least 80 liters, with plenty of hiding spots provided by
rocks, caves, and driftwood. The ideal water temperature ranges from 24-28Â°C, with a pH level of 6.5-7.5 and water
hardness between 5-15 dGH. These loaches prefer soft, sandy substrate to avoid damaging their delicate barbels. A
moderate to strong water flow replicates their natural riverine habitat and is beneficial for their well-being. It's
also essential to have a tight-fitting lid, as they are known to be escape artists.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Ambastaia sidthimunki feeds on small invertebrates, insect larvae, and plant matter. In the
aquarium, they should be offered a varied diet, including high-quality sinking pellets, frozen or live foods like
bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia, along with some vegetable matter such as blanched spinach or cucumber. Feeding
them once or twice a day is sufficient, ensuring they receive a balanced diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Dwarf Chain Loaches involves regular water changes, with around 20-30% of the water being replaced weekly.
They are generally hardy but can be sensitive to poor water quality, so it's essential to monitor water parameters
closely. Regular tank maintenance, including gravel vacuuming and filter cleaning, is necessary to keep the environment
clean and healthy. It's also important to ensure they have plenty of hiding spots to reduce stress.

## Compatibility

Ambastaia sidthimunki is a peaceful species that enjoys the company of its own kind, so it's recommended to keep them in
groups of at least 5-6 individuals. They can coexist well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras,
rasboras, and other loaches. Avoid housing them with large or overly aggressive species that may intimidate or
outcompete them for food. They are active but not overly territorial, making them suitable for community tanks.

## Breeding

Breeding Dwarf Chain Loaches in captivity is challenging and not commonly achieved by hobbyists. They are known to spawn
in large groups in the wild during the rainy season. To attempt breeding, replicate their natural environment by
providing a spacious, well-planted tank with plenty of hiding spots and slightly softer water conditions. Spawning
behavior may involve the males chasing females and engaging in quick, darting movements. After spawning, the eggs are
usually scattered among plants or substrate. If successful, the fry should be fed with finely crushed flakes or
specialized fry food.
