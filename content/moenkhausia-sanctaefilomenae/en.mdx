## Overview

**Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae**, commonly known as the _Red-Eye Tetra_, is a hardy and active fish suitable for both
beginner and experienced aquarists. Known for its silver body and characteristic red eye, this species originates from
South America, where it inhabits slow-moving rivers and streams.

## Tank Requirements

Red-Eye Tetras thrive in aquariums of at least 80 liters. They prefer water temperatures between 22–28°C, with a pH
range of 6.0–7.5 and water hardness between 3–15 dGH. Decorate the tank with plants, driftwood, and rocks, while leaving
ample swimming space. They feel most comfortable in schools of six or more.

## Feeding and Diet

As omnivores, Red-Eye Tetras enjoy a varied diet. Feed them high-quality flakes or pellets as their staple diet,
supplemented with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. They will also accept vegetable matter
such as spinach or spirulina-based foods.

## Care and Maintenance

This species is undemanding and ideal for community tanks. Regular water changes and proper filtration are essential to
maintain optimal water quality. While generally peaceful, they may nip the fins of slow-moving or long-finned tankmates,
so choose companions carefully.

## Compatibility

Red-Eye Tetras are peaceful schooling fish that get along well with similarly sized, non-aggressive tankmates. Good
companions include other tetras, rasboras, and small catfish like corydoras. Avoid keeping them with larger, predatory
species or long-finned fish like bettas or guppies.

## Breeding

Breeding Red-Eye Tetras requires a separate breeding tank with slightly acidic, soft water. Add fine-leafed plants or a
spawning mop for egg deposition. Condition the breeding pair with live foods to stimulate spawning. After spawning,
remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 24–36 hours, and the fry can be fed
infusoria or liquid fry food until they can eat baby brine shrimp.
