## General Information

_Aequidens pulcher_, also known as **Blue Acara**, is a colorful cichlid species native to the freshwater rivers and
lakes of Central and South America. Known for its striking blue-green color and peaceful nature, this species has become
a favorite among aquarists. Although the Blue Acara is a cichlid, it is relatively peaceful and can be kept in a
community tank with other fish of similar size and calm disposition. Its hardiness and moderate size make it suitable
for both novice and experienced aquarists.

Unlike some other cichlid species, the Blue Acara is less demanding in terms of water parameters and more resistant to
changes in aquarium conditions. This makes it a good choice for aquariums with less stable water quality.

### How to Tell Males from Females

Male **Aequidens pulcher** are generally larger, with more vibrant coloration and long, sharp fins, especially the
dorsal and anal fins. During the breeding season, their colors become even more intense, and their bodies take on a more
elongated shape. Females, on the other hand, are smaller and have a more rounded body, particularly around the belly
when preparing to spawn. Their coloration is duller, and their fins are shorter and rounder. Males are more aggressive
and territorial, while females are more peaceful, especially during non-breeding periods.

## Tank Requirements

The Blue Acara thrives in freshwater aquariums that mimic its natural habitat. The ideal temperature range for
**Aequidens pulcher** is between 23 and 28°C, with a pH level of 6.5 to 8.0 and water hardness ranging from 5 to 15 dGH.
A tank size of at least 200 liters is recommended to provide ample space for swimming and the territorial behavior
typical of cichlids.

The aquarium should be equipped with rocks, driftwood, and plants to create hiding spots and break the line of sight,
reducing the likelihood of aggression. Regular water changes and good filtration are necessary to maintain water
quality.

The Blue Acara prefers moderate lighting, which should not be too bright. Aquarium lights with soft light, complemented
by plants with broad leaves, can create shaded areas and help reduce stress in the fish, making the environment more
similar to its natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

**Aequidens pulcher** is an omnivorous species and prefers a varied diet. In the wild, these fish feed on small
invertebrates, plant material, and detritus. In the aquarium, they can be fed a balanced diet that includes high-quality
pellets and flakes designed for cichlids, as well as live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.

You can also offer vegetables, such as boiled peas or chopped spinach. A varied diet promotes vibrant coloration, strong
immunity, and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Aequidens pulcher** involves regular aquarium maintenance and monitoring water parameters to create optimal
conditions. It is recommended to change 20–25% of the water weekly to maintain low nitrate levels and chemical
stability. A reliable heater is necessary to maintain a constant temperature within the recommended range, and a good
filtration system helps keep the water clean and healthy.

Because the Blue Acara can exhibit territorial behavior, especially during breeding, it is important to monitor its
actions and provide enough space. Placing hiding spots such as rocks, driftwood, and plants in the aquarium reduces
stress and minimizes aggression. Regular aquarium maintenance not only supports the health of the fish but also extends
the life of the equipment.

## Compatibility

Although **Blue Acara** is generally more peaceful than many other cichlids, it is still a cichlid and may display
territorial behavior, especially during breeding. For successful tankmates, it is best to choose fish of similar size
and temperament. Ideal companions include large tetras, peaceful barbs, and other South American cichlids with similar
characteristics.

Avoid keeping it with very small fish, as the Blue Acara may perceive them as prey, as well as with aggressive species
that could cause stress. It is essential that the aquarium is large enough and offers plenty of hiding spots to minimize
potential conflicts between fish.

### Plants for Keeping with Blue Acara

For keeping **Aequidens pulcher** (Blue Acara) in the aquarium, it is best to select plants that can withstand its
territorial behavior, will not be easily damaged when used as hiding spots, and provide a comfortable environment for
the fish. Here are some plants that are well-suited for aquariums with Blue Acara:

- **Anubias**: These plants have tough, sturdy leaves that the acaras will not easily damage. Anubias can grow on rocks
  or driftwood or in substrate and requires low to moderate light, making it ideal for aquariums with Blue Acara.

- **Java Moss (Vesicularia dubyana)**: A popular plant for aquariums, Java Moss thrives under low to medium lighting. It
  is excellent for creating hiding spots and can be attached to rocks or driftwood.

- **Cryptocorynes**: These plants have strong leaves that are not easily damaged by the fish. They grow well under soft
  and moderate lighting conditions and require calm water to thrive, making them suitable for aquariums with Blue Acara.

- **Echinodorus**: Large plants that provide excellent hiding spots for the Blue Acara. Echinodorus grows quickly and
  adapts well to various aquarium conditions, making them great companions for cichlids.

- **Vallisneria**: A grassy plant with long, narrow leaves, perfect for creating a living fence in the aquarium.
  Vallisneria grows steadily and is resistant to the presence of Blue Acara, although it is important to monitor its
  spread, as it may grow too much.

- **Cabomba**: A water plant with fine, feathery leaves that works well in aquariums with cichlids. Cabomba prefers
  moderate lighting and clean water, creating an attractive background in the aquarium.

- **Limnophila**: A fast-growing plant that handles high nutrient levels in the aquarium well. Limnophila can provide
  shelter for the fish and also helps keep the water clean.

When choosing plants, it is important to remember that the **Blue Acara** may move or destroy plants in search of food
or for creating hiding spots. It is better to use plants with strong roots and sturdy leaves that can withstand such
interference. You can also attach some plants to rocks or driftwood to prevent them from being moved or eaten by the
fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Aequidens pulcher** in home aquariums is not particularly difficult, provided the optimal conditions are met.
These fish are open spawners and lay eggs on flat surfaces such as rocks or plant leaves. To stimulate breeding, it is
recommended to slightly increase the water temperature to 26-28°C and provide plenty of flat surfaces for egg
deposition.

The female lays several hundred eggs, which are then fertilized by the male. Both parents actively participate in caring
for the eggs and fry, exhibiting strong parental instincts. When the fry begin to swim, they can be fed finely crushed
flakes or brine shrimp nauplii, which promotes healthy growth and development.

The Blue Acara exhibits strong parental instincts, taking care of the eggs and fry. This trait, typical for cichlids,
makes it especially interesting for aquarists who wish to observe the process of raising offspring in the aquarium.
