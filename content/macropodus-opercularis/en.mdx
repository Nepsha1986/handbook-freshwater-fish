## Overview

The Paradise Fish (Macropodus opercularis) is a member of the Osphronemidae family, native to East Asia, where it
inhabits a variety of freshwater environments, including ponds, rice paddies, and slow-moving streams. Recognized by its
striking coloration and elaborate fins, the Paradise Fish can reach a size of 6-8 cm. This species is known for its
hardiness and can thrive in a wide range of water conditions, making it a popular choice for both beginners and
experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Paradise Fish are quite adaptable but thrive best in a tank of at least 60 liters. The water temperature should be kept
between 20-26°C, with a pH range of 6.0-8.0 and a water hardness (GH) of 5-19. They can live in unheated tanks, but it's
important to maintain stable water conditions. The tank should be planted with plenty of vegetation and include hiding
spots such as caves or driftwood to mimic their natural habitat. A gentle water flow is preferable, as these fish are
not strong swimmers.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Paradise Fish are omnivores, feeding on insects, crustaceans, and plant material. In the
aquarium, they should be provided with a varied diet that includes high-quality flakes or pellets, along with live or
frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Feeding them twice a day with portions they can consume within
a few minutes will keep them healthy and vibrant.

## Care and Maintenance

Paradise Fish are relatively easy to care for, requiring regular water changes of 20-25% weekly to maintain water
quality. They are generally hardy but can be prone to common freshwater diseases if water conditions are poor.
Monitoring the water parameters and keeping the tank clean will help prevent issues. Regularly check for any signs of
stress or illness, such as clamped fins or lethargy, and address any concerns promptly.

## Compatibility

Paradise Fish have a semi-aggressive temperament and can be territorial, especially during breeding. They are best kept
with other similarly sized fish that can handle their assertiveness, such as other gouramis or barbs. Avoid keeping them
with very small or long-finned species, as they may nip at fins. It’s essential to provide plenty of hiding places to
help reduce aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Paradise Fish is relatively straightforward. They are bubble nest builders, with the male constructing a nest
at the water surface. To encourage breeding, maintain the water temperature around 24-26°C and provide floating plants
to help the male build the nest. Once the female lays eggs, the male will guard the nest and care for the fry. It’s
advisable to remove the female after spawning to prevent aggression. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed
with infusoria or finely crushed flake food.
