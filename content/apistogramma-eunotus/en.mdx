## Overview

_Apistogramma eunotus_ is a dwarf cichlid from the Cichlidae family, native to shallow forest streams and tributaries of
the Peruvian Amazon. In the aquarium hobby, this species is known as the "Blue Spot Apistogramma" due to the distinctive
pattern of vivid blue spots on the body and fins of males.

Adults reach 5–7 cm in length and live for 3–5 years. As with most apistogrammas, sexual dimorphism is well-pronounced:
males are larger, more colorful, and possess more developed fins with rich blue and yellow hues. Females are smaller,
colored in modest gray-yellow tones, but develop a characteristic intense yellow coloration with black bars during
spawning.

_A. eunotus_ is less common in the hobby than the related [Cockatoo Dwarf Cichlid](/en/apistogramma-cacatuoides) or
[Borelli's Dwarf Cichlid](/en/apistogramma-borellii), but its striking appearance and engaging behavior attract
dedicated dwarf cichlid enthusiasts.

## Tank Requirements

A pair or harem of _Apistogramma eunotus_ (one male and 2–3 females) requires a tank of at least **80 liters**. For a
community setup with other species, a 100-liter or larger tank is preferable.

Optimal water parameters:

- **Temperature:** 24–28 °C
- **pH:** 5.0–7.0
- **Hardness (GH):** 2–10

An important characteristic of this species is its preference for soft, slightly acidic water. In hard, alkaline water,
the fish become pale, lethargic, and prone to disease. Use RO water or peat filtration to maintain appropriate
parameters.

The aquarium should be set up as a forest stream biotope: soft sandy substrate, abundant driftwood, and scattered leaf
litter (oak, Indian almond). The leaf litter not only creates a natural environment but also acidifies the water,
releasing beneficial humic substances. Live plants — cryptocorynes, anubias, Java moss — provide cover and visual
barriers between territories. Each female needs her own cave: a coconut shell, ceramic tube, or rock crevice.

Lighting should be subdued — floating plants (water lettuce, salvinia) will help create shaded areas. Water flow should
be minimal.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apistogramma eunotus_ is an omnivorous species with a strong preference for protein-rich foods. In the wild, they feed
on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and microfauna living in leaf litter.

In the aquarium, the base diet consists of high-quality small cichlid pellets or flakes, but live and frozen foods are
critically important for bringing out coloration and maintaining health:

- **Brine shrimp** — a primary live food, accepted with great enthusiasm
- **Daphnia** — beneficial for digestion and bloat prevention
- **Bloodworms** — a high-calorie treat, offer 1–2 times per week
- **Cyclops** — ideal due to their small size
- **Grindal worms** — excellent for conditioning fish for spawning

Feed twice a day in small portions. _A. eunotus_ are active bottom feeders that methodically sift through sand in search
of food. Make sure food sinks to the bottom and isn't intercepted by faster swimmers in the upper layers.

## Care and Maintenance

The care level for _A. eunotus_ is moderate. This species is more demanding regarding water parameters than some other
apistogrammas and does not tolerate neglected water quality.

Key recommendations:

- **Water changes:** 20–25% weekly, using soft water with matching parameters
- **Filtration:** gentle, without strong current — a sponge filter or air-driven filter is preferable to powerful
  canister filters
- **Substrate:** regularly vacuum the sandy bottom, but carefully — don't disturb the leaf litter layer
- **Parameter monitoring:** check pH and hardness weekly, keep nitrates below 20 mg/L

A healthy _A. eunotus_ is active during the day, curiously explores its territory, and displays rich coloration. Fading
colors, clamped fins, loss of appetite, or constant hiding are warning signs that require an immediate water parameter
check.

## Compatibility

_Apistogramma eunotus_ is a moderately territorial species, especially during breeding. With proper tankmate selection,
it works well in a community aquarium.

Ideal companions are small, schooling fish from the upper and middle water layers that prefer soft water:

- [Neon Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-innesi) and [Cardinal Tetra](/en/paracheirodon-axelrodi) — a classic pairing with
  apistogrammas
- [Dwarf Pencilfish](/en/nannostomus-marginatus) — a calm upper-level swimmer
- [Ember Tetra](/en/hyphessobrycon-amandae) — a peaceful nano tetra
- [Pygmy Corydoras](/en/corydoras-pygmaeus) — a miniature bottom dweller that won't compete for territory
- [Otocinclus](/en/otocinclus-vittatus) — a peaceful algae eater

It is strongly advised against keeping them with other apistogramma species — territorial conflicts are inevitable. Also
avoid large, active, and aggressive fish. The optimal group is one male with 2–3 females. Two males will only coexist in
a spacious tank of 150 liters or more with abundant hiding spots and visual barriers.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apistogramma eunotus_ in a home aquarium is accessible to aquarists with moderate experience. This species is
a cave spawner, and under the right conditions, it breeds readily.

To stimulate spawning:

- Raise the temperature to 26–28 °C
- Reduce water hardness to a minimum (GH 2–4)
- Maintain pH in the 5.5–6.5 range
- Provide each female with a separate shelter
- Increase feeding with live foods

A female ready to spawn develops a vivid yellow coloration, actively lures the male to her cave, and deposits 50–100
eggs on the ceiling of the shelter. After spawning, the female takes full responsibility for the clutch: she fans the
eggs, removes dead ones, and fiercely guards the nest from everyone, including the male.

The larvae hatch in 2–3 days, and the fry become free-swimming around day 5–7. First foods should include artemia
nauplii and infusoria. The female continues to lead her school of fry around the tank for several weeks, teaching them
to find food and hide from danger. For better fry survival, it is recommended to remove the male and other fish or use a
separate breeding tank.
