## Overview

**Otocinclus vittatus**, or Dwarf Sucker, is a small, peaceful catfish species from the Loricariidae family. Native to
South America, they are known for their algae-eating habits, making them a favorite among aquarists who keep planted
tanks.

Growing to only about 4-5 cm, these fish are non-aggressive and prefer to live in groups. They are also well-suited for
smaller tanks due to their size and calm demeanor.

## Tank Requirements

Otocinclus thrive in aquariums with temperatures ranging from 22-26Â°C, a pH of 6.0-7.5, and a GH of 6-15. A tank size of
at least 60 liters is recommended, especially for a group of these fish, as they feel more secure in small schools.

A heavily planted tank with hiding spots such as driftwood and rocks is ideal for them. Soft substrate, such as sand, is
preferable as they like to graze on surfaces for algae. Strong water flow isn't necessary, but maintaining clean,
oxygen-rich water is essential.

## Feeding and Diet

**Otocinclus vittatus** are primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and plant material. In a well-established aquarium
with plenty of algae growth, they will find sufficient food on their own. However, in tanks with less algae, they should
be supplemented with algae wafers and blanched vegetables such as zucchini or spinach.

It's important to monitor their diet to ensure they're getting enough food, as they can sometimes struggle to find
enough natural algae in smaller or newly established aquariums.

## Care and Maintenance

These catfish require stable water conditions with low nitrate levels, as they are sensitive to changes in water
quality. Regular water changes (20-30% weekly) and proper filtration are necessary to maintain optimal conditions.

Due to their delicate nature, they should not be housed with larger or aggressive fish that may bully or outcompete them
for food.

## Compatibility

**Otocinclus vittatus** are extremely peaceful and do well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras,
rasboras, and dwarf cichlids. They should be kept in groups of at least 4-6 individuals to reduce stress and ensure
natural behavior.

Avoid housing them with larger, predatory fish or fin-nippers, as they may be harassed or even eaten due to their small
size.

## Breeding

Breeding **Otocinclus** in home aquariums is difficult and rarely occurs without specific conditions. They are
egg-layers, and successful breeding usually requires pristine water conditions, along with plenty of hiding spots for
the fry once they hatch.

If breeding does occur, the fry will require finely crushed algae-based food and clean water to thrive.
