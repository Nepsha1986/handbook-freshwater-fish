## Overview

The Venustus Cichlid (_Nimbochromis venustus_), also called the Giraffe Hap, is native to Lake Malawi in East Africa. It
is admired for its striking giraffe-like pattern and large size. This visually captivating cichlid has a fascinating
hunting technique: it camouflages itself against the sandy substrate and ambushes smaller fish. Venustus Cichlids are
best suited for experienced aquarists with large aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Venustus Cichlids require a spacious tank of at least 300 liters, with a water temperature range of 24-28Â°C, pH levels
between 7.5 and 8.5, and hardness (GH) of 10-20. They prefer tanks with open swimming areas, rocky formations, and sandy
substrates to replicate their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to maintain water
quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Venustus Cichlids are carnivores that feed on smaller fish. In captivity, a diet of
high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with frozen or live foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, or small feeder
fish, is recommended. Be cautious with feeding to avoid overloading the tank with protein.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25-30% are necessary to maintain the water quality that Venustus Cichlids require. These
cichlids are sensitive to poor water conditions, so diligent care is essential to prevent stress and disease.

## Compatibility

Venustus Cichlids can be semi-aggressive and are best kept with other robust African cichlids of similar size and
temperament. Avoid keeping them with smaller or more timid species, as they may be harassed or preyed upon. It's
important to provide adequate space and hiding spots to minimize aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Venustus Cichlids is possible in captivity. They are mouthbrooders, meaning the female carries the fertilized
eggs in her mouth until they hatch. Providing a separate breeding tank with stable water conditions and hiding spots
will increase fry survival rates.
