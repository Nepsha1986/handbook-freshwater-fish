## Overview

_Apteronotus albifrons_, known as the Black Ghost Knifefish, is one of the most unusual freshwater fish available to
aquarists. This species belongs to the family Apteronotidae and inhabits the Amazon Basin as well as rivers in
Venezuela, Paraguay, and Peru, where it favors shaded areas with slow currents and dense vegetation.

The body of the Black Ghost Knifefish is laterally compressed and completely scaleless, making it particularly sensitive
to chemicals and water quality. The coloration is velvety black with two white markings: one on the caudal peduncle and
one on the forehead, which gives the species its name _albifrons_ (white-fronted). In aquariums, the fish grows to 20–50
cm, and its lifespan is 10–15 years, making it a truly long-term companion.

The defining feature of the Black Ghost Knifefish is the weak electric field it generates for navigation in murky water
and locating food. Thanks to electroreception, the fish "sees" its surroundings perfectly even in complete darkness and
can find prey hidden in the substrate.

## Tank Requirements

Keeping _Apteronotus albifrons_ requires an aquarium of at least 350 liters — this is a large, active fish that needs
space. Optimal water parameters are: temperature 23–28 °C, pH 6.5–7.5, and general hardness GH 5–15.

The aquarium setup should include plenty of hiding spots: driftwood, ceramic tubes, rock caves, and dense plant
thickets. The Black Ghost Knifefish is nocturnal and hides in shelters during the day, so without them the fish will
experience constant stress. Many aquarists use transparent tubes — this allows observing the fish during the day without
disturbing it.

The substrate should be fine and soft — sand or small rounded gravel. The skin of the Black Ghost Knifefish is
scaleless, and coarse substrate can damage it. Lighting should be subdued: floating plants will help create diffused
light. Water flow should be gentle to moderate.

## Feeding and Diet

_Apteronotus albifrons_ is a predator that feeds on aquatic insects, larvae, worms, and small fish in the wild. In the
aquarium, the core diet should consist of live and frozen foods: bloodworms, tubifex, glassworms, brine shrimp, as well
as small pieces of shrimp and fish fillet.

Some individuals gradually adapt to quality sinking pellets, but the transition to dry food should be slow, and it
should not be the sole food source. Flakes are unsuitable — the Black Ghost Knifefish feeds primarily near the bottom
and in the middle water layers.

It is best to feed in the evening, after the main lights are turned off, when the fish emerges from its shelter and
becomes active. Young fish should be fed daily, adults every other day, in portions consumed within 5–10 minutes.

## Care and Maintenance

The Black Ghost Knifefish is a demanding species not recommended for beginner aquarists. The lack of scales makes it
especially sensitive to ammonia and nitrite levels, as well as copper-based and formalin medications. Weekly water
changes of 25–30% are essential.

Filtration should be powerful and efficient but without creating strong currents. An external canister filter is the
best choice for a tank with this species. Regular water testing is mandatory: ammonia and nitrites must remain at zero,
and nitrates should stay below 20 mg/l.

It is important to remember that the Black Ghost Knifefish generates a weak electric field. Keeping two individuals in
the same aquarium is not advisable — their electric fields will interfere with each other, causing chronic stress and
aggression.

## Compatibility

_Apteronotus albifrons_ is generally calm toward tankmates but has a moderate temperament and may display
territoriality, especially toward bottom-dwelling fish and other knifefish species. It coexists best with medium to
large peaceful fish that inhabit the middle and upper water layers.

Good tankmates include [Angelfish](/en/pterophyllum-scalare), [Severums](/en/heros-severus),
[Pearl Gouramis](/en/trichopodus-leerii), [Congo Tetras](/en/phenacogrammus-interruptus), and larger
[Corydoras](/en/corydoras-sterbai). Small fish — neons, guppies, and small rasboras — will be viewed as food, especially
at night.

Housing with other knifefish and aggressive cichlids such as [Oscars](/en/astronotus-ocellatus) is strongly discouraged,
as they can injure the scaleless Black Ghost Knifefish.

## Breeding

Breeding _Apteronotus albifrons_ in aquariums is extremely difficult and rarely accomplished in practice. The breeding
difficulty is rated at the maximum — 5 out of 5. In commercial facilities, spawning is induced using hormonal injections
and by simulating the rainy season: lowering the temperature followed by raising it, accompanied by massive soft water
changes.

Determining the sex visually is nearly impossible — males and females are almost indistinguishable externally. Sexual
maturity is reached at 1.5–2 years of age when the fish is approximately 15–20 cm long. A breeding pair requires a
separate, darkened tank of at least 400 liters with numerous hiding places.

In a home setting, it is best to focus on providing comfortable keeping conditions and leave breeding to specialized
facilities. Most Black Ghost Knifefish on the market are wild-caught or bred on farms in Southeast Asia.
