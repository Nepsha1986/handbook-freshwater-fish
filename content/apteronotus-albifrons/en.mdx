## Overview

**Apteronotus albifrons**, commonly known as the Black Ghost Knifefish, is a captivating species native to the
freshwater rivers of South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin. This fish is known for its smooth, elongated body
and striking black coloration, with a distinctive white band on its tail and nose. Growing up to 50 cm (20 inches) in
length, the Black Ghost Knifefish is a popular choice for experienced aquarists due to its unique appearance and
fascinating behaviors, including its ability to produce electric fields to navigate and communicate in its environment.

## Tank Requirements

The Black Ghost Knifefish requires a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 350 liters (90 gallons) to accommodate its
large size and active swimming habits. The water temperature should be maintained between 23-28°C (73-82°F), with a pH
range of 6.5 to 7.5 and general hardness (GH) between 5-15. It's important to provide plenty of hiding spots, such as
caves, driftwood, and dense vegetation, as this species is nocturnal and prefers dimly lit environments. Soft, sandy
substrate is recommended to protect their delicate skin, and low-flow water conditions mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Apteronotus albifrons is a carnivorous species that primarily feeds on small invertebrates and fish in the wild. In an
aquarium setting, they can be fed a diet of live or frozen foods, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small fish. Some
may accept high-quality pellets or flakes, but live or frozen food is preferred to keep them healthy and mimic their
natural feeding behavior. It's important to feed them during the evening or night when they are most active.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for the Black Ghost Knifefish requires attention to their specific needs, particularly their sensitivity to water
quality and need for a large, well-maintained aquarium. Regular water changes and efficient filtration are crucial, as
this species produces a significant amount of waste. They are generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially
towards other knifefish or similar species. Due to their nocturnal nature, it's best to provide a calm and quiet
environment during the day, with minimal disturbances to prevent stress.

## Compatibility

The Black Ghost Knifefish is best kept with other peaceful species of similar size that can thrive in soft, slightly
acidic water. Good tank mates include large tetras, gouramis, and cichlids that are not overly aggressive. They should
not be kept with very small fish, as these may be seen as prey. Avoid housing them with other knifefish unless the tank
is exceptionally large to provide enough territory for each fish. A well-planned tank setup with plenty of hiding places
will help reduce territorial disputes and stress.

## Breeding

Breeding Apteronotus albifrons in captivity is extremely difficult and rarely achieved. In the wild, they are known to
breed in large, slow-moving rivers, but the exact conditions required for successful spawning in an aquarium are not
well documented. If breeding is attempted, it would likely require a very large, well-established tank with specific
water parameters and environmental cues. There is limited information on the breeding habits of this species in home
aquariums, and successful breeding is typically observed only in specialized facilities.
