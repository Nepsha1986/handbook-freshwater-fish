## Overview

**Steatocranus casuarius**, commonly known as the **Buffalo Cichlid** or **Buffalo Head Cichlid**, is a distinctive
freshwater fish native to the Congo River Basin in Africa. This species is known for its robust body and prominent
forehead, which gives it a buffalo-like appearance. Growing up to 8-12 cm in length, the Buffalo Cichlid is a hardy fish
that can adapt to various tank conditions but requires specific care to thrive.

## Tank Requirements

**Steatocranus casuarius** requires a spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 200 liters. The ideal water temperature
ranges from 24-28Â°C, with a pH of 7.0 to 8.5 and water hardness (GH) between 10-20. The tank should be well-filtered and
include hiding spots and structures to mimic their natural habitat. Providing a substrate of sand or fine gravel will
help them feel more secure.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Buffalo Cichlids** feed on a variety of invertebrates and small fish. In captivity, they should be
provided with a diet that includes high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as worms, and occasional vegetable
matter. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and vibrant coloration. Feed them 2-3 times a day with
appropriate portion sizes.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **Steatocranus casuarius** involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a well-structured
environment. Regular water changes of 25-30% weekly are recommended to ensure water quality. Monitor water parameters
closely and adjust as necessary to keep them within the ideal range. While the Buffalo Cichlid is relatively hardy, they
can be territorial and may display aggressive behavior, especially during breeding.

## Compatibility

**Steatocranus casuarius** can be kept with other robust, non-aggressive fish. Suitable tank mates include other
cichlids and large community fish. Avoid housing them with smaller or more timid species, as they may be intimidated.
Providing plenty of hiding spots and territories will help reduce aggression and ensure a peaceful tank environment.

## Breeding

Breeding **Steatocranus casuarius** in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. They are substrate spawners and
require a separate breeding tank with stable water conditions. The male will create a nest site and attract the female
to lay eggs. After spawning, the female will guard the eggs and care for the fry once they hatch. Providing ample hiding
spots and a varied diet will support successful breeding and the health of the offspring.
