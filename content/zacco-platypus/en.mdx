## Overview

Zacco platypus, commonly called the Pale Chub, is a freshwater fish native to East Asia, particularly found in rivers
and streams of Japan, Korea, and China. This species has a streamlined body, silver scales with a slight metallic sheen,
and is known for its active behavior. Pale Chubs are resilient fish that can adapt to a wide range of environments,
making them an interesting addition to aquariums designed to mimic river-like conditions.

## Tank Requirements

Zacco platypus requires a tank of at least 80 liters with good water circulation to simulate its natural habitat of
flowing rivers. The ideal water temperature should be between 18-24°C, with a pH level of 6.0-7.5, and water hardness
(GH) of 5-15. A sandy substrate with rocks and driftwood provides a natural setting, while moderate water flow will help
them feel at home. Maintaining clean water with regular filtration is crucial for their well-being.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Pale Chubs feed on insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter. In captivity, they readily accept
high-quality flake foods, pellets, and live or frozen foods like bloodworms, daphnia, or brine shrimp. A varied diet
will help them maintain their vibrant colors and overall health. Feeding them 2-3 times daily with small portions is
recommended.

## Care and Maintenance

Zacco platypus is a relatively easy species to care for, provided their water is kept clean and well-oxygenated. They
require regular water changes and a filtration system that ensures a good flow of water. While they are hardy, it’s
essential to maintain stable water parameters to prevent stress and illness. Regular tank cleaning and monitoring are
important to keep them healthy.

## Compatibility

Pale Chubs are peaceful and can live harmoniously with other non-aggressive fish species. They do well in community
tanks with species that enjoy similar conditions, such as other riverine fish. It's best to avoid placing them with
overly aggressive or territorial species. They are schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least 5-6
individuals to reduce stress and promote natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Zacco platypus in captivity can be challenging but possible with the right conditions. They are egg scatterers
and require a well-planted aquarium or spawning mops for the eggs to attach. After spawning, it's crucial to remove the
adults as they may eat the eggs. The eggs usually hatch within 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely
crushed fish food.
