## Overview

Garra mullya, also called the Mullya Garra, is a freshwater fish native to the rivers and streams of South Asia. It is
recognized for its algae-eating capabilities and active behavior. With an elongated body and suction-like mouth, this
fish thrives in fast-moving waters. It’s a great choice for aquarium enthusiasts looking for a peaceful, helpful fish
that aids in algae control.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum of 120 liters is recommended for Garra mullya. The water temperature should range between 22-26°C, with a pH
level of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of 5-12 dGH. The tank should have good water flow, resembling a riverbed
environment, with smooth rocks and driftwood to provide hiding spots and enrichment.

## Feeding and Diet

In their natural habitat, Garra mullya feeds primarily on algae and biofilm. In captivity, a diet of sinking algae
wafers, blanched vegetables, and occasional protein-based foods like bloodworms is ideal. Feeding should be varied to
keep the fish healthy and support its algae-eating behavior.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes and tank maintenance are essential for the health of Garra mullya. Water quality should be
monitored weekly to ensure stable parameters. This fish is generally hardy but may be sensitive to sudden changes in
water conditions. Cleaning the tank and ensuring good water flow will help maintain its well-being.

## Compatibility

Garra mullya is semi-peaceful, making it a good fit for community tanks. However, it can sometimes display territorial
behavior toward other bottom-dwelling species. It is best to house it with other non-aggressive fish that occupy
different levels of the tank to avoid conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding Garra mullya in captivity is considered difficult. It requires a well-established, stable tank with controlled
water conditions. There is limited information on the specific breeding triggers, but maintaining a stress-free
environment with hiding places may help encourage breeding behaviors.
