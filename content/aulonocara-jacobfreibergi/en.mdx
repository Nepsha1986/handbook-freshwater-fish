## Overview

_Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ is one of the largest and most spectacular Aulonocara species, inhabiting the rocky biotopes
of Lake Malawi. The species is named after collector Jakob Freiberg and is known among aquarists by the poetic names
"Malawi Butterfly" and "Fairy Cichlid."

Males grow to 12–15 cm and display impressive coloration: a metallic blue head and back transition into golden-orange or
bright yellow flanks, while the dorsal and anal fins are elongated and vividly colored. Numerous geographic morphs exist
with different color variations — from deep red to lemon yellow. Females are plain — grayish-brown with faint vertical
bars. Lifespan is 5–10 years.

In the wild, _Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ lives near cave entrances and rock crevices, where it hunts small invertebrates
using a well-developed system of sensory pores on the lower jaw. This is a larger and more territorial Aulonocara
compared to related species such as the [Eureka Red Peacock](/en/aulonocara-eureka).

## Tank Requirements

Keeping _Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ requires an aquarium of at least 200 liters. Optimal water parameters are:
temperature 24–28 °C, pH 7.5–8.5, and general hardness GH 10–20. These parameters replicate the alkaline conditions of
Lake Malawi.

The setup should include massive rock formations with caves and passageways — in nature, this species lives specifically
near cave entrances. Arrange rocks to create distinct territories with visual barriers. The substrate must be sand to
allow the fish to display their natural feeding behavior — sifting substrate through their gills.

Open swimming space in the center of the aquarium is essential. Live plants are used sparingly due to the alkaline
water, but Anubias and Vallisneria can survive. Lighting should be moderate to bright, highlighting the metallic sheen
of their coloration.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, _Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ is a micro-predator that feeds on small invertebrates, larvae, crustaceans, and
zooplankton, detecting them using sensory pores on its jaw. In the aquarium, the fish is unfussy, but proper nutrition
is critically important for health and coloration.

The staple diet should consist of quality pellets for Malawi cichlids with carotenoids to enhance color. Supplement with
frozen foods: brine shrimp, mysis, cyclops, and bloodworms. Live food is an excellent addition but should be offered
cautiously due to the risk of infection.

Feed twice daily in moderate portions consumed within 2–3 minutes. Do not overfeed — Malawi cichlids are predisposed to
bloating (Malawi bloat), especially with excess fatty food. Exclude foods based on mammalian proteins (beef heart).
Vegetable supplements (spirulina, blanched spinach) should be offered 1–2 times per week.

## Care and Maintenance

_Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ is a moderately demanding cichlid (care level 3 out of 5) that requires stable water
parameters and regular maintenance. Weekly water changes of 25–30% are mandatory. Filtration should be powerful: a
canister filter with a turnover rate of at least 4–5 tank volumes per hour.

Test water regularly: ammonia and nitrites must stay at zero, nitrates below 20 mg/l. Malawi cichlids are extremely
sensitive to nitrate accumulation, and elevated levels are a common cause of disease.

Monitor the fish's condition: darkened coloration, refusal to eat, and rapid breathing are the first signs of stress or
developing illness. Malawi bloat is the primary threat, prevented through clean water, balanced nutrition, and
minimizing stress.

## Compatibility

_Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ is a notably territorial cichlid with a behavior rating of 4 out of 5, significantly more
aggressive than most other Aulonocara. Males actively defend their territory and may chase competitors. It is best to
keep one male with 3–4 females in a harem arrangement.

Suitable tankmates include other Aulonocara ([Aulonocara nyassae](/en/aulonocara-nyassae),
[Aulonocara maylandi](/en/aulonocara-maylandi)), as well as peaceful haplochromines —
[Copadichromis](/en/copadichromis-borleyi), [Protomelas](/en/protomelas-taeniolatus), and
[Sciaenochromis](/en/sciaenochromis-fryeri). Among mbuna, only the calmest species are acceptable, such as
[Labidochromis](/en/labidochromis-caeruleus).

Absolutely unsuitable: aggressive mbuna ([Pseudotropheus](/en/pseudotropheus-zebra),
[Maylandia](/en/maylandia-lombardoi)), and large predatory cichlids like [Nimbochromis](/en/nimbochromis-venustus).
Small fish must not be kept with them — they will be eaten. Avoid combining male Aulonocara of similar coloration in the
same tank.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara jacobfreibergi_ is achievable at home — difficulty rated 3 out of 5. Like all Aulonocara, they are
maternal mouthbrooders: the female carries fertilized eggs in her mouth for 18–21 days.

To stimulate spawning, ensure stable water parameters and generous live food feedings. The male claims a territory near
a cave or large rock and actively displays his coloration, spreading his fins. Spawning occurs on a flat surface: the
female lays eggs, immediately collects them in her mouth, and fertilizes them by being attracted to the "egg spots" on
the male's anal fin.

The brooding female stops eating entirely and stays hidden in shelter. Fry must not be released in the main tank — they
will be killed by tankmates. Move the female to a separate 30–50 liter tank 3–5 days before the fry are released. A
typical clutch contains 20–40 fry. First food should be baby brine shrimp and finely crushed pellets. The fry grow
relatively quickly, and the first signs of male coloration appear at 4–5 months.
