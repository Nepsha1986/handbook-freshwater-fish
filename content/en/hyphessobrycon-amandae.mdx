## Overview

Hyphessobrycon amandae, commonly known as the Ember Tetra, is a small freshwater fish native to the Rio Xingu in Brazil.
Recognizable by its vibrant orange-red color and small size, this tetra is a favorite among aquarium enthusiasts for its
striking appearance and peaceful nature. Its compact size and colorful display make it a perfect addition to community
tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Ember Tetras thrive in a well-planted tank with gentle water flow. A minimum tank volume of 40 liters is recommended.
Maintain a water temperature between 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate
and plenty of hiding spots among plants and driftwood. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to keep
the water quality high.

## Feeding and Diet

Hyphessobrycon amandae is an omnivorous fish with a small mouth. In the wild, they feed on tiny insects and plant
matter. In the aquarium, they will readily accept high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and occasional live or frozen
foods such as daphnia, cyclops, and brine shrimp. A varied diet will ensure they remain healthy and vibrant.

## Care and Maintenance

Care for Ember Tetras involves regular water changes and monitoring water parameters to ensure optimal conditions.
Perform weekly water changes of 20-30% to maintain water quality. Watch for signs of stress or illness, such as changes
in behavior or physical appearance. Providing a stable environment and proper nutrition will help keep them healthy.

## Compatibility

Hyphessobrycon amandae is a peaceful species that gets along well with other small, non-aggressive fish. They are
suitable for community tanks with species like small tetras, rasboras, and peaceful dwarf cichlids. Avoid housing them
with larger, aggressive fish that might view them as prey. Keeping them in groups of at least six will help reduce
stress and encourage natural behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Ember Tetras in captivity can be achieved with some preparation. Set up a breeding tank with soft, slightly
acidic water and a temperature around 26-28°C. Provide a dense plant cover or spawning mops where the fish can lay eggs.
After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 3-4 days, and the
fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food until they are large enough to handle regular foods.
