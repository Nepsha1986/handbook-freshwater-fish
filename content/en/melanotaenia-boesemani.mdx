## Overview

_Melanotaenia boesemani_, commonly known as Boeseman's Rainbowfish, is a stunning freshwater species native to the
rivers and streams of Papua New Guinea. This fish is renowned for its vibrant coloration, featuring brilliant shades of
blue and orange that make it a striking addition to any aquarium. Boeseman's Rainbowfish is appreciated for its peaceful
nature and active swimming behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Boeseman's Rainbowfish thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 150 liters. They prefer a
temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. The tank should be well-planted with plenty of swimming
space, and a soft substrate like sand or fine gravel is ideal. A good filtration system is essential to maintain water
quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Melanotaenia boesemani_ is an omnivorous species with a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on a mix of small
invertebrates, aquatic insects, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality flakes, pellets, and live
or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Offering a balanced diet will help maintain their health
and enhance their coloration. Feed them 2-3 times a day with portions suitable to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Boeseman's Rainbowfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are
relatively easy to care for and make a great addition to community tanks due to their peaceful nature. Regular water
changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues like fin rot or ich. Their
active nature means they will benefit from a well-structured tank with plenty of space to swim.

## Compatibility

_Melanotaenia boesemani_ is a peaceful and social fish that prefers to be kept in schools of at least 6-10 individuals.
They can be housed with other non-aggressive species that can tolerate similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates
include other rainbowfish, tetras, and small to medium-sized community fish. Avoid housing them with aggressive or very
large fish, as they may become stressed or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Melanotaenia boesemani_ in captivity can be achieved with the right setup. They are egg-scattering fish, and
breeding can be encouraged by providing a well-planted tank with plenty of open swimming space. To promote breeding,
maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and offer a varied diet to the breeding pair. The female will scatter eggs among
the plants or substrate, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming. Proper
care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy fry.
