## Overview
The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is one of the most popular and widely kept freshwater aquarium fish due to its lively personality and attractive coloration. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, guppies are small, hardy fish with a wide variety of color patterns and tail shapes. They are adaptable and can thrive in a range of water conditions, making them ideal for both beginners and experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements
Guppies are adaptable and can live in a variety of tank setups. A minimum tank volume of 40 liters is recommended for a small group of guppies. The ideal water temperature for guppies is between 22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.8-7.8 and a general hardness (GH) of 10-30. A good filtration system is essential to maintain water quality, as guppies produce moderate amounts of waste. They appreciate a tank with plenty of plants, hiding spots, and open swimming areas.

## Feeding and Diet
Guppies are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, consisting of small insects, algae, and detritus. In an aquarium, they should be fed a high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. Guppies also enjoy occasional vegetable matter like blanched spinach or spirulina. Feeding them 2-3 times a day in small portions will ensure they get the necessary nutrients and maintain their vibrant colors.

## Care and Maintenance
Guppies are low-maintenance fish, but regular care is still important. Perform water changes of about 20-30% weekly to maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters regularly and clean the tank and filter as needed. Guppies are generally healthy but can be prone to diseases like ich and fin rot. Keeping the tank clean and providing a balanced diet will help prevent these issues.

## Compatibility
Guppies are peaceful and sociable fish that do well in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. They are best kept in groups of at least five to encourage natural schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include other small, peaceful fish such as tetras, rasboras, and small livebearers. Avoid keeping guppies with large or aggressive fish that may see them as prey or compete for food.

## Breeding
Breeding guppies is straightforward and often happens easily in a community tank. Guppies are livebearers, meaning they give birth to free-swimming fry rather than laying eggs. To breed guppies, provide a well-maintained tank with plenty of hiding spots for the pregnant females. After birth, the fry should be separated from the adults to prevent them from being eaten. The fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
