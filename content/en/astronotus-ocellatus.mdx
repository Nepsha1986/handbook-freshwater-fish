## Overview

_Astronotus ocellatus_, commonly known as the Oscar, is a large and highly intelligent cichlid native to South America.
Oscars are recognized for their vibrant colors and distinctive patterns, which can include variations of red, orange,
and black, often with eye-like spots on their bodies. They are known for their curious and interactive behavior, making
them a popular choice for large home aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Oscars require a spacious aquarium due to their large size, with a minimum volume of 300 liters recommended. They thrive
in a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a robust filtration system to
handle the high bioload they produce and a substrate that can withstand their digging behavior, such as smooth gravel or
sand. Providing hiding spots and decorations can help reduce stress and mimic their natural environment.

## Feeding and Diet

_Astronotus ocellatus_ is an omnivorous species with a hearty appetite. In the wild, they feed on a variety of foods,
including fish, insects, and crustaceans. In captivity, they will accept a wide range of foods, including high-quality
pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as shrimp, worms, and fish. It’s important to provide a balanced diet to
maintain their health and vibrant coloration. Regular feeding should be done 2-3 times a day, with careful attention to
portion sizes to avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Oscars involves maintaining clean and stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform regular
water changes of 20-30% weekly to ensure good water quality. Monitor the fish for common health issues such as ich or
fin rot, and address any problems promptly. Due to their large size and potential for aggressive behavior, providing
ample space and appropriate tank mates is crucial to their well-being.

## Compatibility

_Astronotus ocellatus_ can be territorial and aggressive, especially as they mature. They are best kept with other
large, robust fish that can tolerate their size and temperament. Avoid housing Oscars with smaller or more delicate
species, as they may become targets of aggression. Tank mates should be chosen carefully to ensure they are compatible
with the Oscar's behavior and size.

## Breeding

Breeding _Astronotus ocellatus_ in captivity can be successful with the right conditions. Oscars are substrate spawners
and will lay their eggs on a flat surface or in a designated spawning area. To encourage breeding, maintain a
temperature around 26-28°C and provide a well-structured tank with ample hiding spots. After spawning, both parents will
typically guard the eggs and fry. The fry can be fed finely crushed pellets or specialized fry food once they are
free-swimming. Proper care and monitoring are essential to ensure successful breeding and healthy fry.
