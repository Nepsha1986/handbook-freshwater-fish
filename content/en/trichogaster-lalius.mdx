## Overview

_Trichogaster lalius_, commonly known as the Dwarf Gourami, is a small, colorful fish native to the rivers and ponds of
India and Bangladesh. Recognized for its vibrant coloration, which can range from bright red to blue and orange, this
species is a popular choice for aquarium enthusiasts. Dwarf Gouramis are known for their peaceful nature and can add a
splash of color to community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

Dwarf Gouramis thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 40 liters. They prefer a temperature range
of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. Provide a soft substrate and include plenty of plants, driftwood, and
hiding spots to create a comfortable environment. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to maintain
water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Trichogaster lalius_ is an omnivorous fish with a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects, worms, and
plant matter. In the aquarium, they will accept high-quality flake food, pellets, and live or frozen foods such as brine
shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. Offering a balanced diet will help enhance their coloration and ensure their overall
health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Dwarf Gouramis involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform weekly water
changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues such as fin rot or
fungal infections, and address any problems promptly. Regular maintenance and a stable environment are crucial for their
well-being.

## Compatibility

_Trichogaster lalius_ is known for its peaceful and non-aggressive nature, making it ideal for community tanks. They get
along well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid housing them with
larger or more aggressive species that may pose a threat. Keeping them in groups of at least three can help them feel
secure and exhibit natural behaviors.

## Breeding

Breeding _Trichogaster lalius_ in captivity can be successfully achieved with proper setup. Provide a separate breeding
tank with a temperature around 26-28°C and slightly acidic to neutral water conditions. The male will build a bubble
nest on the water’s surface, and the female will lay eggs into the nest after spawning. Remove the female after spawning
to prevent her from being harassed. The eggs will hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely
crushed food until they are large enough for regular feedings.
