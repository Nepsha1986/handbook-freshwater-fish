## Overview
*Ancistrus dolichopterus*, commonly known as the Longfin Bristlenose Catfish, is a distinctive freshwater fish native to the rivers and streams of South America. This species is well-known for its elongated fins and bristly, armored body, which gives it a unique appearance. The Longfin Bristlenose Catfish is popular among aquarium enthusiasts for its interesting look and beneficial role in algae control.

## Tank Requirements
Longfin Bristlenose Catfish thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. They prefer a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a substrate of sand or fine gravel and include plenty of hiding spots, such as driftwood and rocks, to provide shelter and replicate their natural environment. A good filtration system is important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet
*Ancistrus dolichopterus* is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and plant matter in the wild. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of high-quality algae wafers, sinking pellets, and fresh vegetables such as cucumber and zucchini. They may also appreciate occasional protein sources like live or frozen foods. Providing a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance their coloration. Feed them once or twice a day, with portions that suit their size.

## Care and Maintenance
Caring for Longfin Bristlenose Catfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are relatively easy to care for and make a great addition to community tanks due to their peaceful nature. Regular water changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as algae blooms or fin rot. Their algae-eating behavior helps keep the tank clean and reduces maintenance.

## Compatibility
*Ancistrus dolichopterus* is a peaceful and non-aggressive species that can be kept with a variety of tank mates. They are suitable for community tanks with other peaceful fish and can coexist with many species, including other catfish. Avoid housing them with aggressive or very large fish that might outcompete them for food or cause stress. Providing ample hiding spots and territories will help prevent any potential conflicts.

## Breeding
Breeding *Ancistrus dolichopterus* in captivity is relatively straightforward. They are cave-spawning fish, with the male taking responsibility for guarding the eggs and fry. To encourage breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and provide a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots and caves. The female will lay eggs in a cave or sheltered area, and the male will fertilize and protect them until they hatch. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy fry.
