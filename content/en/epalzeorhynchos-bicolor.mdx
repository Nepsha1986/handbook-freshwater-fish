## Overview

The Labeo Bicolor, scientifically known as _Epalzeorhynchos bicolor_, is a striking fish from the Cyprinidae family. It
is native to Thailand and is recognized for its unique black body contrasted by a vibrant red tail. This fish is also
known as the Redtail Shark due to its appearance, despite not being a true shark. It is a popular choice for aquariums
due to its distinctive look and active behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Labeo Bicolor requires a tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters to provide enough space for its growth and activity.
Maintain water temperatures between 22°C and 26°C, with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH level ranging from
6.5 to 7.5. Provide plenty of hiding spots and plants to mimic their natural habitat and reduce stress.

## Feeding and Diet

Labeo Bicolor is omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods. Its diet should include high-quality flakes or pellets,
supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms. Additionally, offer vegetable matter such as
blanched spinach or spirulina-based foods. Feed them once or twice a day and ensure any uneaten food is removed to
maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care involves monitoring water quality and feeding the fish. Perform weekly water changes (about 25% of the tank
volume) and clean the tank to prevent algae buildup. Monitor the fish’s health for signs of common issues such as fin
rot or ich, and address any problems promptly.

## Compatibility

Labeo Bicolor can be territorial and may exhibit aggressive behavior, especially towards fish of similar size or
appearance. It is best kept with other robust, fast-swimming fish such as barbs, danios, and larger tetras. Avoid
keeping them with slow-moving or very small fish that might be bullied.

## Breeding

Breeding Labeo Bicolor in captivity is difficult and rarely successful. They require specific conditions and often do
not breed in home aquariums. Breeding usually occurs in large, controlled environments or professional breeding
facilities. If breeding is attempted, ensure a well-maintained environment with plenty of hiding spots and optimal water
conditions.
