## Overview
*Gnathonemus petersii*, commonly known as the Elephant Nose Fish or Elephantfish, is a remarkable freshwater fish native to the rivers and swamps of West Africa. This species is noted for its distinctive, trunk-like snout, which it uses to forage for food in the murky waters of its natural habitat. The Elephant Nose Fish is also known for its unique electrosensory abilities, which it uses to navigate and locate prey in dark or turbid waters.

## Tank Requirements
Elephant Nose Fish require a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 200 liters. They prefer a temperature range of 24-28Â°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand, and include plenty of hiding spots and driftwood to replicate their natural environment. A good filtration system is essential to keep the water clean, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary to maintain optimal water quality.

## Feeding and Diet
*Gnathonemus petersii* is primarily a carnivorous species that feeds on small invertebrates and fish in the wild. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as worms, shrimp, and small fish. Providing a varied diet is crucial to ensure their health and well-being. Feeding should be done 1-2 times a day, with appropriate portion sizes to avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance
Caring for Elephant Nose Fish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. They are sensitive to changes in water quality, so regular water changes and monitoring of water parameters are important. Due to their nocturnal nature, they are best observed in the evening or at night. Their peaceful temperament makes them suitable for community tanks with other non-aggressive species, but they may be shy and require hiding spots to feel secure.

## Compatibility
*Gnathonemus petersii* is generally peaceful but can be sensitive to aggressive or overly active tank mates. They are best kept with other small to medium-sized, non-aggressive fish that can tolerate their nocturnal behavior. Suitable tank mates include other peaceful fish from similar habitats. Avoid housing them with larger or more aggressive species that might cause stress or compete for resources.

## Breeding
Breeding *Gnathonemus petersii* in captivity is challenging and has rarely been accomplished. They are known to be mouthbrooders in the wild, with the female carrying the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, maintain optimal water conditions and provide a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots. Breeding behavior is not well-documented in captivity, so successful breeding may require additional research and careful observation of their natural behaviors.
