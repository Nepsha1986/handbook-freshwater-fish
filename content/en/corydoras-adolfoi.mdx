## Overview

_Corydoras adolfoi_, commonly known as Adolfo's Cory, is a small, attractive catfish native to the Rio Orinoco basin in
South America. This species is recognized for its striking pattern, featuring a pale body with distinct dark spots and a
distinctive color contrast on its fins. Adolfo's Cory is a peaceful and social fish, making it a popular choice for
community aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Adolfo's Corys do well in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They prefer a temperature range
of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. Provide a soft substrate, such as fine gravel or sand, and include plenty
of hiding spots with plants, driftwood, and other decorations to create a comfortable environment. A good filtration
system and regular water changes are essential to maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Corydoras adolfoi_ is an omnivorous fish with a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small invertebrates, worms, and
detritus. In the aquarium, they will accept high-quality sinking pellets, flakes, and occasional live or frozen foods
such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Providing a balanced diet will help maintain their health and vibrant
coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

To care for Adolfo's Corys, focus on maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform weekly
water changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues such as fin rot
or fungal infections, and address any problems promptly. Regular maintenance and a stable environment are crucial for
their well-being.

## Compatibility

_Corydoras adolfoi_ is known for its peaceful and social behavior, making it an excellent addition to community tanks.
They get along well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras, rasboras, and small cichlids. Avoid housing
them with larger or more aggressive species that may pose a threat. Keeping them in groups of at least six is ideal, as
they are social fish that thrive in the company of their own kind.

## Breeding

Breeding _Corydoras adolfoi_ in captivity can be successfully achieved with the right setup. Provide a separate breeding
tank with a temperature around 26-28°C and slightly acidic to neutral water conditions. Use a soft substrate and include
spawning mops or flat surfaces for egg deposition. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from consuming the
eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 4-5 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food until they are
large enough to handle regular feedings.
