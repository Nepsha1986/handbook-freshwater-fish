## Overview
*Trichopodus leerii*, commonly known as the Leopard Gourami or Leeri Gourami, is a striking freshwater fish native to the slow-moving waters of Southeast Asia. This species is admired for its unique and attractive coloration, which features a pattern of spots and stripes resembling a leopard's coat. The Leopard Gourami is known for its peaceful nature and can be a beautiful addition to a community aquarium.

## Tank Requirements
Leopard Gourami thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 150 liters. They prefer a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand or fine gravel, and include plenty of hiding spots and swimming space. They also appreciate having plants and decorations to mimic their natural habitat. A reliable filtration system is important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet
*Trichopodus leerii* is an omnivorous species with a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects, worms, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance their coloration. Feed them once or twice a day with portions appropriate to their size.

## Care and Maintenance
Caring for Leopard Gourami involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are relatively easy to care for and adapt well to aquarium life. Regular water changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as fin rot or ich. Their peaceful and calm demeanor makes them suitable for community tanks with other non-aggressive species.

## Compatibility
*Trichopodus leerii* is a generally peaceful fish that can be kept with a variety of non-aggressive species that share similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates include other gouramis, tetras, peaceful catfish, and small to medium-sized community fish. Avoid housing them with aggressive or very small fish, as they may become stressed or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding
Breeding *Trichopodus leerii* in captivity can be accomplished with the right setup. They are bubble-nest builders, and breeding can be encouraged by providing a spacious tank with plenty of hiding spots and a varied diet. To promote breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and ensure good water quality. The male will build a bubble nest at the surface, and the female will lay eggs into it. The male will guard the nest and the fry once they hatch. The fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming. Proper care and monitoring are crucial for successful breeding and healthy fry.
