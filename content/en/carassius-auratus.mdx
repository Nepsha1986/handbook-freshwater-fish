## Overview
Goldfish (Carassius auratus) are among the most popular and recognizable aquarium fish, cherished for their bright colors and varied tail shapes. Originating from East Asia, they have been bred for centuries, resulting in numerous varieties with unique appearances. Goldfish are hardy and adaptable, making them suitable for both beginners and experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements
Goldfish require a spacious and well-maintained tank to thrive, with a minimum volume of 75 liters for a single fish, and an additional 40 liters for each additional fish. The ideal water temperature for goldfish is between 18-24°C, with a pH range of 6.5-8.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-19. A robust filtration system is essential to maintain water quality, as goldfish produce a significant amount of waste. They appreciate a tank setup with plenty of swimming space, a substrate of gravel or sand, and decorations like plants and rocks for hiding and exploring.

## Feeding and Diet
Goldfish are omnivorous and have a varied diet in both the wild and captivity. They should be fed high-quality goldfish flakes or pellets, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. Additionally, they enjoy plant matter like blanched vegetables (e.g., peas, spinach) as part of their diet. Feeding them 2-3 times a day in small portions will help prevent overfeeding and maintain their health.

## Care and Maintenance
Goldfish are relatively easy to care for but require regular maintenance to keep their environment clean and healthy. Perform regular water changes of about 20-30% weekly to maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters frequently and clean the tank and filters as needed. Goldfish are prone to common diseases like ich, swim bladder disorder, and fin rot. Maintaining clean water conditions and providing a balanced diet will help prevent these health issues.

## Compatibility
Goldfish are generally peaceful and can coexist with other goldfish varieties. However, due to their specific care requirements, they are best kept in a species-only tank. Suitable tank mates include other goldfish or cold-water species like white cloud mountain minnows. Avoid keeping goldfish with tropical fish that require warmer water or aggressive species that may nip their fins.

## Breeding
Breeding goldfish can be achieved with the right conditions and care. To breed goldfish, provide a spacious breeding tank with slightly cooler water temperatures (around 18-20°C) and plenty of vegetation or spawning mops for egg-laying. Increase the temperature gradually to stimulate spawning behavior. After spawning, the female will scatter eggs, which will adhere to plants or other surfaces. Remove the adults after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 4-7 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
