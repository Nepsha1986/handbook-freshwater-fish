## Overview

_Hoplosternum thoracatum_, commonly known as the Thoracatum Catfish or Armored Catfish, is a freshwater fish native to
the slow-moving rivers and streams of South America. This species is noted for its robust, armored body and peaceful
demeanor. The Thoracatum Catfish has a distinctive appearance with bony plates covering its body, which provides
protection in its natural habitat.

## Tank Requirements

Thoracatum Catfish thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. They prefer a temperature
range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand or fine gravel,
and include plenty of hiding spots and driftwood to replicate their natural environment. A good filtration system is
important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Hoplosternum thoracatum_ is an omnivorous species with a diet that includes a variety of foods. In the wild, they feed
on detritus, small invertebrates, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality pellets, flakes, and live
or frozen foods such as worms, shrimp, and small insects. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and
enhance their coloration. Feed them once or twice a day, with portions suitable to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Thoracatum Catfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are
relatively easy to care for and make a great addition to community tanks due to their peaceful nature. Regular water
changes and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Their
armored body helps them resist physical damage, but they still require proper care to thrive.

## Compatibility

_Hoplosternum thoracatum_ is a peaceful and social fish that can be kept with a variety of tank mates. They are best
housed with other non-aggressive species that can tolerate similar water conditions. Suitable tank mates include other
catfish, tetras, and small to medium-sized community fish. Avoid housing them with larger or more aggressive species, as
they may become stressed or compete for food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Hoplosternum thoracatum_ in captivity is relatively rare and not well-documented. They are egg-scattering
fish, and breeding can be encouraged by providing a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots and a varied diet.
Maintaining a temperature around 26-28°C and ensuring good water quality are essential. The eggs will be scattered among
the substrate or hiding spots, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food once they are free-swimming.
Proper care and monitoring are crucial for successful breeding and healthy fry.
