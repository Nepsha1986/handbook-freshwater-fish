## Overview

_Cyrtocara moorii_, commonly known as the Blue Dolphin Cichlid, is a striking fish native to Lake Tanganyika in East
Africa. This species is celebrated for its unique appearance, which includes a pronounced, dolphin-like forehead and
vibrant blue coloration. The Blue Dolphin Cichlid is a peaceful and majestic fish, making it a popular choice for large,
well-maintained aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Blue Dolphin Cichlids need a spacious aquarium with a minimum volume of 300 liters due to their size and territorial
nature. They thrive in a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 7.5 and 9.0. The tank should have a
substrate of sand or fine gravel and be decorated with rocks and caves to create hiding spots and territories. A robust
filtration system is essential to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary.

## Feeding and Diet

_Cyrtocara moorii_ is an omnivorous species with a diet that should include high-quality cichlid pellets, flakes, and
occasional live or frozen foods such as shrimp, fish, and worms. In the wild, they feed on smaller fish and
invertebrates. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance their natural coloration. Feed them
2-3 times a day, ensuring that portions are appropriate to avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Blue Dolphin Cichlids involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. Perform
regular water changes and monitor the fish for common health issues like ich or fin rot. Their peaceful nature makes
them suitable for community tanks with other large, non-aggressive species. Due to their territorial behavior, it is
important to provide ample hiding spots and space to minimize stress and conflicts.

## Compatibility

_Cyrtocara moorii_ is generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They are best kept with
other large, robust fish that can tolerate their size and temperament. Suitable tank mates include other cichlids from
Lake Tanganyika and larger species that are not overly aggressive. Avoid housing them with small or overly aggressive
fish to prevent stress and potential conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Cyrtocara moorii_ in captivity is possible with the right setup. They are mouthbrooders, meaning the female
carries the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and
provide a well-structured tank with ample hiding spots and territories. After spawning, the female will incubate the
eggs and fry in her mouth for about 3-4 weeks. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed finely crushed pellets or
specialized fry food. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy fry.
