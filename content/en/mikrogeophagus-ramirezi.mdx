## Overview

The Ram Cichlid (_Mikrogeophagus ramirezi_) is a small, vibrant cichlid native to the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela
and Colombia. Known for its striking blue and yellow coloration, this fish is a favorite among aquarium enthusiasts. It
is peaceful compared to many other cichlids and can be a great addition to a community tank.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank size of 100 liters is recommended for the Ram Cichlid. Maintain a water temperature between 24°C and
28°C, with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The general hardness should be between 6 and 12 dGH. Provide plenty of hiding
spots and territories with plants, rocks, and driftwood to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Ram Cichlids are omnivorous and will accept a variety of foods. In the wild, they eat small invertebrates and plant
matter. In captivity, offer high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms, and
occasional vegetable matter. Feed them 2-3 times a day to ensure balanced nutrition.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care includes checking water quality and feeding the fish. Weekly maintenance involves monitoring the filtration
system, performing partial water changes, and inspecting the fish for any signs of illness or stress. Common issues
include fin rot and external parasites, which can be treated with appropriate medications.

## Compatibility

Ram Cichlids are generally peaceful and can be kept with other non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include small
to medium-sized fish that are not overly aggressive. Avoid keeping them with larger or overly aggressive species that
might bully them.

## Breeding

Breeding _Mikrogeophagus ramirezi_ in captivity requires a well-maintained tank with stable water conditions. Males will
establish a territory and court females with vibrant displays. The female will lay eggs on a flat surface, and both
parents will care for the eggs and fry. Provide fine food and a safe environment for the fry to thrive.
