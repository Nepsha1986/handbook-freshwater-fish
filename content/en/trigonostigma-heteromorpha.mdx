## Overview

_Trigonostigma heteromorpha_, commonly known as the Harlequin Rasbora, is a small, colorful fish native to the streams
and rivers of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Singapore. It is easily recognizable by its vibrant orange
body with a distinctive black triangular patch near the base of the tail. This peaceful species is popular among
aquarists for its striking appearance and lively behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Harlequin Rasboras thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 40 liters. They prefer a temperature
range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. Provide a soft substrate and include plenty of plants, driftwood,
and hiding spots to create a comfortable and secure environment. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential
for maintaining water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Trigonostigma heteromorpha_ is an omnivorous fish that enjoys a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects,
worms, and plant matter. In the aquarium, they will accept high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and live or frozen
foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Offering a balanced diet will help enhance their coloration and
ensure their overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Harlequin Rasboras involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform weekly
water changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues like fin rot or
fungal infections and address any problems promptly. Regular maintenance and a stable environment are crucial for their
well-being.

## Compatibility

_Trigonostigma heteromorpha_ is known for its peaceful and social nature, making it an excellent choice for community
tanks. They get along well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as tetras, rasboras, and small catfish. Avoid
housing them with larger or more aggressive species that may pose a threat. Keeping them in groups of at least six will
help them feel secure and exhibit natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding _Trigonostigma heteromorpha_ in captivity is feasible with the right setup. Provide a separate breeding tank
with a temperature around 26-28°C and slightly acidic to neutral water conditions. The female will lay eggs among the
plants or spawning mops, and after spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from consuming the eggs. The eggs will
hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food until they are large enough to eat
regular feedings.
