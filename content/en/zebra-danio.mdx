## Overview
The zebra danio (Danio rerio) is a popular freshwater fish known for its striking horizontal blue and silver stripes. Native to South Asia, zebra danios are small, active fish that are hardy and adaptable to various water conditions. They are ideal for community tanks and are suitable for both novice and experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements
Zebra danios thrive in a well-maintained tank with a minimum volume of 40 liters. They prefer a water temperature between 18-24°C, with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 and a general hardness (GH) of 5-15. A good filtration system is important to keep the water clean, as zebra danios are quite active and produce a moderate amount of waste. They appreciate a tank with plenty of swimming space, as well as some plants and hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet
Zebra danios are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, including small insects, worms, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they should be fed a balanced diet consisting of high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. They also benefit from occasional vegetable matter. Feeding them 2-3 times a day in small portions will help keep them healthy and maintain their vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance
Zebra danios are relatively low-maintenance but require regular care to ensure a healthy environment. Perform water changes of about 20-30% weekly to maintain water quality. Regularly monitor water parameters and clean the tank and filters as needed. Zebra danios are generally healthy but can be prone to common diseases like ich and fin rot. Keeping the tank clean and providing a balanced diet will help prevent these issues.

## Compatibility
Zebra danios are peaceful and sociable fish that do well in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. They are best kept in groups of at least five to encourage natural schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include other small, peaceful fish such as tetras, guppies, and rasboras. Avoid keeping zebra danios with larger or aggressive fish that may outcompete them for food or cause stress.

## Breeding
Breeding zebra danios is relatively easy and often happens naturally in community tanks. To breed zebra danios, provide a separate breeding tank with a slightly acidic to neutral pH (around 6.5-7.0) and a temperature of about 22-24°C. Add some fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for egg-laying. Zebra danios scatter their eggs, so remove the adults after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 2-3 days, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
