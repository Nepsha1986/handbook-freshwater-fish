## Overview
The *Thorichthys meeki*, commonly known as the Firemouth Cichlid, is a vibrant and attractive fish native to the rivers and lakes of Central America. This species is characterized by its striking red-orange coloration on the throat area, which becomes more vivid when the fish feels threatened or during breeding displays. They are medium-sized cichlids that thrive in well-structured environments with plenty of hiding spots.

## Tank Requirements
To keep *Thorichthys meeki* healthy, provide a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 200 liters. Maintain a water temperature between 24°C and 28°C, and ensure the pH level ranges from 6.5 to 7.5. A general hardness of 10 to 15 dGH is ideal. The tank should be well-filtered and include hiding places and territories to accommodate their territorial nature. A substrate of fine gravel or sand is recommended, along with rocks and driftwood for decoration.

## Feeding and Diet
*Thorichthys meeki* is an omnivorous fish that requires a varied diet. In their natural habitat, they consume a mix of insects, small invertebrates, and plant matter. In an aquarium, provide high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods like bloodworms, and occasional vegetable matter. Feeding should occur 2-3 times a day, with portions they can consume within a few minutes.

## Care and Maintenance
Daily care involves monitoring water conditions and feeding the fish. Weekly tasks include checking the filtration system and performing partial water changes to maintain water quality. Regularly inspect the fish for signs of illness or stress, such as changes in behavior or physical appearance. Common issues include fin rot or external parasites, which can be treated with appropriate medications.

## Compatibility
*Thorichthys meeki* can be kept with other medium to large-sized fish that are not overly aggressive. They may exhibit territorial behavior, especially during breeding. Suitable tank mates include other cichlids of similar size and peaceful species like larger tetras or barbs. Avoid keeping them with very small fish or overly aggressive species.

## Breeding
Breeding *Thorichthys meeki* in captivity requires a well-established tank with stable water conditions. Males and females will establish a territory and perform a courtship dance, which includes displaying their vibrant throat coloration. Once spawning occurs, the female will lay eggs on a flat surface, such as a rock or a broad leaf. Both parents will guard the eggs and the fry once they hatch. Provide suitable conditions for the fry, including fine food and a safe environment.
