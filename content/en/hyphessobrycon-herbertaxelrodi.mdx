## Overview

Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi, commonly known as Axelrod's Tetra or Blue Tetra, is a small, striking fish native to the
Rio Orinoco and Rio Negro basins in South America. It is admired for its vibrant blue coloration, which can sometimes
display a shimmering iridescence. This peaceful species is a great choice for adding color and activity to community
aquariums.

## Tank Requirements

Axelrod's Tetras require a well-planted tank with a minimum volume of 40 liters. Maintain a water temperature between
24-28°C and a pH level of 6.0 to 7.5. Provide a soft substrate and include plenty of plants, driftwood, and hiding spots
to mimic their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to keep the water quality
optimal.

## Feeding and Diet

Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi is an omnivorous fish that thrives on a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small
insects, worms, and plant material. In the aquarium, offer a mix of high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and
occasional live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Providing a balanced diet will help maintain
their vibrant coloration and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Proper care for Axelrod's Tetras involves regular tank maintenance and monitoring of water parameters. Perform weekly
water changes of 20-30% to ensure clean water conditions. Check for common health issues such as fin rot or white spot
disease, and address any problems promptly. A stable environment and proper nutrition are key to their well-being.

## Compatibility

Axelrod's Tetras are known for their peaceful nature and are well-suited for community tanks. They get along well with
other small, non-aggressive fish such as other tetras, rasboras, and peaceful cichlids. Avoid keeping them with larger
or more aggressive species that may pose a threat. It’s best to keep them in groups of at least six to reduce stress and
promote natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. Set up a separate breeding tank
with soft, slightly acidic water and a temperature around 26-28°C. Provide spawning mops or fine-leaved plants for egg
deposition. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from consuming the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 3-4 days,
and the fry can be fed infusoria or powdered fry food until they are large enough to consume regular foods.
