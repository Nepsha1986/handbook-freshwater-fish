## Overview

_Pimelodus pictus_, commonly known as the Pictus Catfish or Spotted Catfish, is a small and active freshwater species
native to the rivers and streams of South America. This fish is characterized by its striking pattern of black spots on
a silver body, which makes it a visually appealing addition to an aquarium. Pictus Catfish are known for their playful
and energetic behavior, particularly during the night.

## Tank Requirements

Pictus Catfish require a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 100 liters. They prefer a temperature range
of 24-28°C and a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. The tank should have a soft substrate, such as sand or fine gravel, and
include plenty of hiding spots and swimming space, as they are active swimmers and appreciate having places to explore.
A good filtration system is important to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are
recommended.

## Feeding and Diet

_Pimelodus pictus_ is an omnivorous species that feeds on a variety of foods in the wild, including small fish, insects,
and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed high-quality pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as worms,
shrimp, and small fish. Offering a varied diet will help maintain their health and support their active lifestyle. Feed
them once or twice a day with portions appropriate to their size.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Pictus Catfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. They are
relatively easy to care for but require a well-structured tank to accommodate their active nature. Regular water changes
and monitoring of water parameters are essential to prevent common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Their nocturnal
behavior means they are more active at night, so they will benefit from a tank setup that provides plenty of
stimulation.

## Compatibility

_Pimelodus pictus_ is a peaceful fish that can be kept with other non-aggressive species that can tolerate similar water
conditions. They are best housed with other medium-sized fish that are not too small, as they might be seen as prey.
Suitable tank mates include other catfish, tetras, and medium-sized community fish. Avoid housing them with overly
aggressive species or very small fish, as they may become stressed or outcompeted for food.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pimelodus pictus_ in captivity is rare and can be challenging due to their specific requirements and the need
for a large, well-maintained tank. They are egg-scattering fish, and breeding can be encouraged by providing a spacious
tank with plenty of hiding spots and a varied diet. To promote breeding, maintain a temperature around 26-28°C and
ensure good water quality. The eggs will be scattered in the tank, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed
food once they are free-swimming. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy fry.
