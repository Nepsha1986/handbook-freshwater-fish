## Overview

The platy fish (Xiphophorus maculatus) is a popular freshwater species known for its bright colors and lively behavior.
Native to Central America, platies are small, hardy fish that come in various colors and patterns. They are easy to care
for and adapt well to community tanks, making them a great choice for both beginner and experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Platy fish thrive in a well-maintained tank with a minimum volume of 40 liters. They prefer a water temperature between
22-28Â°C, with a pH range of 6.8-8.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 10-30. A good filtration system is essential to
maintain water quality, as platies produce a moderate amount of waste. They appreciate a tank setup with plenty of
plants, open swimming areas, and hiding spots.

## Feeding and Diet

Platy fish are omnivorous and have a varied diet. In the wild, they consume algae, small invertebrates, and plant
matter. In an aquarium, platies should be fed a balanced diet that includes high-quality flake or pellet food,
supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. They also enjoy occasional
vegetable matter like blanched spinach or spirulina. Feeding them 2-3 times a day in small portions will help keep them
healthy and vibrant.

## Care and Maintenance

Platy fish are relatively low-maintenance but require regular care to keep their environment clean. Perform water
changes of about 20-30% weekly to maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters regularly and clean the tank and
filters as needed. Platies are generally healthy but can be prone to common diseases like ich and fin rot. Keeping the
tank clean and providing a balanced diet will help prevent these issues.

## Compatibility

Platy fish are peaceful and social, making them excellent tank mates for community setups. They do well in groups and
can coexist with other non-aggressive species. Suitable tank mates include tetras, guppies, rasboras, and other peaceful
livebearers. Avoid keeping platies with large or aggressive fish that may outcompete them for food or cause stress.

## Breeding

Breeding platy fish is straightforward, as they are livebearers. To breed platies, provide a spacious tank with plenty
of hiding spots for the pregnant females. The female will give birth to free-swimming fry, which should be separated
from the adults to prevent predation. The fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large
enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
