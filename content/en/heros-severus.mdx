## Overview
Heros Severus, commonly known as Severum or Banded Cichlid, belongs to the Cichlidae family and originates from the Amazon Basin in South America. This species is well-known for its distinctive bands and can vary in color, often displaying shades of green, gold, and blue. Severums are relatively peaceful compared to other cichlids and are valued for their hardiness and unique appearance.

## Tank Requirements
A tank of at least 200 liters is recommended for Heros Severus, providing ample space for swimming and growth. Maintain water temperatures between 24°C and 28°C, with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH level of 6.0-7.0. A sandy substrate with plenty of hiding spots, rocks, and driftwood is ideal to mimic their natural habitat and make them feel secure.

## Feeding and Diet
Heros Severus is omnivorous and should be offered a varied diet. High-quality cichlid pellets or flakes should form the staple diet, supplemented with live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and vegetables such as peas and spinach. Feed them once or twice daily and remove any uneaten food to maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance
Regular maintenance involves checking water parameters and performing weekly water changes of about 25%. Monitor for any signs of common health issues like ich or fin rot and treat promptly. Ensure the tank is clean and well-maintained to prevent disease and stress.

## Compatibility
Heros Severus is relatively peaceful but can become territorial during breeding. They are best kept with other similarly sized fish such as larger tetras, barbs, and other peaceful cichlids. Avoid housing them with overly aggressive species or very small fish that might be perceived as food.

## Breeding
Breeding Heros Severus is relatively straightforward compared to other cichlids. They are open breeders and will lay eggs on flat surfaces like rocks or driftwood. Provide a well-maintained environment with stable water conditions to encourage breeding. The parents will care for the eggs and fry, but it is advisable to separate them if other tank mates are present to prevent predation.
