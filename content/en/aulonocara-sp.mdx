## Overview

The Strawberry Peacock Cichlid (_Aulonocara sp._) is a captivating fish native to the Lake Malawi region of Africa.
Known for its stunning red and orange coloration, this species is a popular choice among cichlid enthusiasts. The
Strawberry Peacock is a relatively peaceful cichlid with a tendency to exhibit vibrant colors and elaborate fin
displays, particularly when interacting with its environment or during breeding.

## Tank Requirements

To provide a suitable environment for the Strawberry Peacock Cichlid, a tank with a minimum volume of 150 liters is
recommended. Maintain a water temperature between 24°C and 28°C, and keep the pH level between 7.5 and 8.5. The general
hardness should be between 10 and 15 dGH. The tank should be well-filtered and include ample hiding places and
territories, such as rocks and driftwood, to simulate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

_Strawberry Peacock Cichlid_ is primarily carnivorous but will accept a varied diet. In the wild, they consume small
invertebrates and fish. In captivity, provide high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and
bloodworms, and occasional vegetable matter. Feed them 2-3 times a day, ensuring they receive a balanced diet for
optimal health and coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care involves monitoring water quality and feeding the fish. Weekly tasks include checking the filtration system,
performing partial water changes, and inspecting the fish for any signs of illness or stress. Common health issues
include fin rot and external parasites, which can be treated with appropriate medications.

## Compatibility

The Strawberry Peacock Cichlid is a relatively peaceful cichlid and can be kept with other non-aggressive fish. They do
well in a community tank with other Malawi cichlids and robust species that can handle their occasional territorial
behavior. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive species or very small fish that might be bullied.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara sp._ in captivity requires a well-established tank with stable water conditions and plenty of
hiding places. Males will display their vibrant colors and perform courtship displays to attract females. The female
will lay eggs in a hidden spot, and both parents will guard the eggs and the fry once they hatch. Provide fine food and
a safe environment for the fry to ensure their successful growth.
