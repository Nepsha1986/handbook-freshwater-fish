## Overview

_Pterophyllum altum_, commonly known as the Altum Angelfish, is a large and striking cichlid native to the Amazon River
Basin. Recognizable by its tall, triangular fins and elongated body, this species is known for its majestic appearance
and can reach sizes up to 25 cm in length. The Altum Angelfish is often found in deeper, slower-moving waters and is a
popular choice among experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Altum Angelfish require a spacious tank with a minimum volume of 200 liters to accommodate their size and swimming
needs. They thrive in a well-planted aquarium with soft, slightly acidic water conditions. Maintain a temperature
between 26-30°C and a pH level of 5.5 to 7.0. Provide a soft substrate and include plenty of hiding spots and vertical
space, such as driftwood and tall plants, to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

_Pterophyllum altum_ is an omnivorous fish that requires a varied diet to stay healthy. In the wild, they feed on small
invertebrates, insects, and plant matter. In the aquarium, offer high-quality flake food, pellets, and occasional live
or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia. A balanced diet will help maintain their vibrant coloration
and overall health.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Altum Angelfish involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a suitable diet. Perform regular
water changes of 20-30% weekly to ensure clean water. Monitor the fish for common issues such as fin rot or white spot
disease and address any health concerns promptly. Due to their size and specific needs, regular tank maintenance is
essential for their well-being.

## Compatibility

_Pterophyllum altum_ is generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They are best kept with
other large, non-aggressive fish that can handle their size and occasional assertiveness. Suitable tank mates include
large tetras, peaceful cichlids, and certain catfish species. Avoid housing them with small or overly aggressive fish
that may stress or be bullied by the Altum Angelfish.

## Breeding

Breeding _Pterophyllum altum_ in captivity can be challenging but achievable with the right setup. Provide a separate
breeding tank with soft, slightly acidic water and a temperature around 28-30°C. Include spawning sites such as flat
surfaces or vertical surfaces for egg laying. After spawning, remove the adults to protect the eggs and fry. The eggs
typically hatch in 2-4 days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed food until they are large enough to
handle regular feedings.
