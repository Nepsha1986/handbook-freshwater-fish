## Overview

The Bloodfin Tetra (Aphyocharax anisitsi) is a popular freshwater fish originating from the rivers and streams of South
America, particularly in the regions of Paraguay and Brazil. First described in 1907, this species is well-loved by
aquarists for its vibrant red fins and active schooling behavior.

Bloodfin Tetras are hardy and can adapt to a variety of water conditions, making them ideal for both beginners and
experienced aquarists. Their striking appearance and peaceful nature make them a beautiful addition to community tanks.

## Tank Requirements

To keep Bloodfin Tetras healthy and vibrant, it is essential to provide them with the right tank conditions:

- **Water Temperature:** Maintain the water temperature between 22-28째C (72-82째F). This range ensures their activity and
  well-being.

- **Tank Volume:** A minimum of 60 liters (16 gallons) is recommended. This allows enough space for a school of Bloodfin
  Tetras to swim freely.

- **Water Hardness (GH):** Keep the water hardness between 5-15 dGH. Moderately hard water supports their health and
  longevity.

- **pH:** Maintain a pH range of 6.0-8.0. They are tolerant of a wide pH range but thrive best in slightly acidic to
  neutral water.

## Feeding and Diet

Bloodfin Tetras are omnivores and have a varied diet. In their natural habitat, they feed on small invertebrates, plant
matter, and algae. In an aquarium setting, they should be fed a balanced diet that includes:

- **Flake Food:** High-quality flake food designed for tropical fish.

- **Live/Frozen Foods:** Offer brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms occasionally to provide variety and enhance their
  coloration.

- **Vegetable Matter:** Supplement their diet with blanched spinach or zucchini to ensure they receive essential
  nutrients.

## Care and Maintenance

Bloodfin Tetras are relatively easy to care for, but certain maintenance practices are necessary to keep them healthy:

- **Filtration and Aeration:** Good filtration and aeration are crucial. Ensure the tank has a reliable filter and
  moderate water flow to simulate their natural habitat.

- **Regular Water Changes:** Perform regular partial water changes (about 25% weekly) to maintain water quality and
  reduce nitrate levels.

- **Hiding Spots and Plants:** Include plenty of plants and hiding spots. Plants like Java fern, Anubias, and floating
  plants provide shelter and reduce stress.

## Compatibility

Bloodfin Tetras are peaceful and make excellent community tank members. They get along well with other non-aggressive
fish of similar size. Consider the following when choosing tankmates:

- **Peaceful Species:** They coexist well with other tetras, rasboras, guppies, and small catfish.

- **Avoid Aggressive Fish:** Do not keep them with aggressive or much larger fish that may bully or prey on them.

- **Schooling Fish:** Bloodfin Tetras are schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least 6 to feel secure and
  display natural behaviors.

## Breeding

Breeding Bloodfin Tetras in captivity is possible with the right conditions:

- **Breeding Tank:** Set up a separate breeding tank with fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop to encourage egg-laying.

- **Water Conditions:** Maintain slightly acidic water with a pH of around 6.5 and a temperature of 25-26째C (77-79째F).

- **Spawning Behavior:** Condition the breeding pair with high-quality live foods. The female will scatter eggs among
  plants, and the male will fertilize them.

- **Fry Care:** After spawning, remove the parents to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about
  24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to eat crushed flakes or
  baby brine shrimp.

Bloodfin Tetras are rewarding fish to keep and can add a splash of color and activity to any community aquarium.
