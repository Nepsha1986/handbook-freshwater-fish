## Overview

The Bloodfin Tetra, scientifically known as _Aphyocharax anisitsi_, is a popular freshwater fish characterized by its
vibrant red fins and silver body. Native to the river systems of South America, particularly in the Paraná River basin,
this species is known for its hardiness and adaptability. Bloodfin Tetras are small, schooling fish that thrive in
groups and are well-suited for community aquariums due to their peaceful nature.

## Tank Requirements

Bloodfin Tetras require a tank of at least 60 liters to accommodate their active swimming behavior and to provide ample
space for schooling. The ideal water temperature for this species ranges from 22°C to 28°C, with a pH level between 6.0
and 8.0. They prefer soft to moderately hard water, with a General Hardness (GH) of 5-19. A well-filtered tank with a
gentle water flow, plants, and hiding spots will create a comfortable environment for these fish.

## Feeding and Diet

Bloodfin Tetras are omnivores and thrive on a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects, crustaceans, and
plant matter. In an aquarium setting, they readily accept high-quality flake foods, pellets, and live or frozen foods
such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. It's recommended to feed them small amounts several times a day to mimic
their natural feeding habits and ensure they receive a balanced diet.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Bloodfin Tetras involves regular water changes and tank maintenance to keep the water parameters stable and
healthy. Weekly water changes of 25-30% are recommended. Monitoring the water's temperature, pH, and hardness is crucial
to prevent stress and disease. Bloodfin Tetras are generally hardy but can be prone to common fish diseases if kept in
suboptimal conditions. Ensuring a clean tank and a varied diet helps maintain their health and vitality.

## Compatibility

Bloodfin Tetras are peaceful and can coexist with a variety of other non-aggressive fish species. They make excellent
tank mates for other small to medium-sized community fish such as Neon Tetras, Corydoras catfish, and Rasboras. However,
they should not be housed with large or aggressive fish that may see them as prey. Bloodfin Tetras are schooling fish
and should be kept in groups of at least six to promote natural behavior and reduce stress.

## Breeding

Breeding Bloodfin Tetras in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. To encourage breeding, set up a separate
breeding tank with slightly acidic water (pH around 6.5) and a temperature of 24-26°C. Use fine-leaved plants or a
spawning mop to provide a place for the female to lay eggs. Bloodfin Tetras are egg scatterers and do not exhibit
parental care, so it's important to remove the adults after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs
typically hatch within 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food once they are
free-swimming.
