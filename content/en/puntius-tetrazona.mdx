## Overview

The Sumatra Barb, scientifically known as _Puntius tetrazona_, is a vibrant and active fish that belongs to the
Cyprinidae family. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra, this species is recognized for its vivid coloration
and dynamic behavior. Sumatra Barbs are often seen in aquariums due to their striking appearance and engaging
activities.

## Tank Requirements

For Sumatra Barbs, a tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters is recommended. Keep water temperatures between 24°C and
28°C, with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH level ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. Provide a well-planted tank with
plenty of open swimming space and hiding spots to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

Sumatra Barbs are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods. Their diet should include high-quality flakes or pellets,
supplemented with live or frozen foods such as bloodworms and brine shrimp. Offer food twice a day and ensure that any
uneaten food is removed to maintain water quality.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care includes monitoring water quality and feeding the fish. Perform weekly water changes (about 25% of the tank
volume) and clean the tank to prevent algae buildup. Check for common health issues like fin rot or parasites, and
address any problems promptly.

## Compatibility

Sumatra Barbs are generally peaceful but can be a bit nippy. They do well with other non-aggressive species such as
tetras, rasboras, and other barbs. Avoid keeping them with very small or overly aggressive fish that might be stressed
or harmed by their behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Sumatra Barbs in captivity can be successful with the right setup. Provide a breeding tank with plenty of
plants or spawning mops. The female will lay eggs, which the male will fertilize. After spawning, remove the adults to
prevent them from eating the eggs. Keep the water clean and feed the fry with finely crushed food until they are large
enough for standard fish food.
