## Overview

The Green Terror, scientifically known as _Aequidens rivulatus_, is a strikingly colorful and popular cichlid species
native to the freshwater habitats of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Known for their vibrant green and
blue coloration with shimmering scales, these fish can grow up to 12 inches (30 cm) in length. Green Terrors are admired
for their bold appearance and are a favorite among aquarium enthusiasts who appreciate their dynamic personalities and
territorial behaviors.

These fish are relatively hardy and can adapt to various water conditions, making them suitable for experienced
aquarists. However, they are best kept in a large tank with plenty of space, hiding spots, and a stable environment to
thrive. Green Terrors can be aggressive, especially during breeding, so careful consideration of tank mates and proper
tank management is crucial.

## Tank Requirements

Green Terrors are large, active cichlids that require ample space and specific tank conditions to thrive. Here are the
key tank requirements for keeping Green Terrors:

- **Tank Size:** A minimum of 55 gallons (208 liters) is recommended for a single Green Terror. For a pair or community
  setup, a tank of 75 gallons (284 liters) or larger is ideal to provide adequate space and reduce aggression.

- **Temperature:** Maintain water temperatures between 72-80°F (22-27°C).

- **pH Level:** Green Terrors prefer a pH range of 6.5-8.0, with slightly acidic to neutral water being ideal.

- **Hardness:** Soft to moderately hard water, with a general hardness (GH) of 8-20 dGH.

- **Lighting:** Moderate lighting is suitable for Green Terrors. While they do not have specific lighting needs, avoid
  overly bright lights to reduce stress.

- **Filtration and Aeration:** Green Terrors produce a significant amount of waste, so a strong filtration system is
  necessary to maintain water quality. Additionally, good aeration and water movement help to keep the environment
  oxygenated.

These tank requirements help ensure that Green Terrors live a healthy and comfortable life in captivity.

## Feeding and Diet

Green Terrors are omnivorous and have a diverse diet in the wild, consisting of insects, crustaceans, plant matter, and
small fish. In captivity, providing a varied diet is essential for their health and vibrant coloration.

High-quality cichlid pellets or flakes should form the basis of their diet. These commercial foods are specially
formulated to meet the nutritional needs of cichlids and help enhance their natural colors.

### Protein Sources

Supplement their diet with protein-rich foods such as:

- Live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.
- Insects like crickets and mealworms, either live or freeze-dried.
- Small pieces of fish or shrimp.

### Vegetable Matter

Include vegetable matter to mimic their natural diet. Offer blanched vegetables such as spinach, zucchini, or peas.
Spirulina-based foods are also beneficial for providing necessary nutrients and fiber.

### Feeding Frequency

Feed Green Terrors 1-2 times daily, providing only as much food as they can consume within a few minutes. This helps
prevent overfeeding and maintain water quality.

### Dietary Considerations

- Avoid feeding fatty or oily foods excessively, as they can lead to health issues.
- Remove any uneaten food promptly to prevent water contamination.

## Care and Maintenance

- Perform weekly water changes of 25-30% to maintain water quality and reduce waste accumulation. Regular changes help
  prevent issues related to ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.

- Regularly test water parameters such as pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and hardness. Adjust as necessary to keep
  conditions within the recommended ranges for Green Terrors.

- Vacuum the substrate during water changes to remove debris and uneaten food that can contribute to poor water quality.

- Clean or replace filter media as needed to ensure efficient filtration. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for
  maintenance schedules.

### Substrate and Decor

Ensure that the tank is well-decorated with hiding spots, rocks, and caves to provide territorial boundaries and reduce
stress. Use a sandy or fine gravel substrate, which is gentle on the fish's body. Provide plenty of hiding spots and
territories using rocks, caves, driftwood, and plants. Be sure to secure decorations to prevent tipping, as Green
Terrors may dig or rearrange the tank.

## Compatibility

Green Terrors are known for their assertive and sometimes aggressive behavior, which makes selecting compatible tank
mates crucial. They are best suited for aquariums with other robust and large fish that can handle their territorial
nature.

Ideal companions for Green Terrors include other large cichlids, such as Oscars, Severums, and other aggressive or
semi-aggressive species. They can also be kept with large catfish or large barbs that are not overly territorial or
aggressive.

**Small or delicate fish are not suitable tank mates for Green Terrors**. Avoid species that are likely to be bullied or
harassed, such as smaller tetras, gouramis, or peaceful community fish.

During breeding, Green Terrors can become particularly aggressive and territorial. It is advisable to either separate
breeding pairs or provide ample space and hiding spots to minimize conflicts with other tank mates.

If keeping Green Terrors in a community tank, ensure that the tank is large enough to accommodate the space needs of all
inhabitants and reduce the risk of aggression. Providing plenty of hiding spots and visual barriers can help mitigate
territorial disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding Green Terrors can be a rewarding experience for experienced aquarists, but it requires careful attention to
detail due to their territorial and aggressive nature. Here’s what you need to know to successfully breed Green Terrors:

To encourage breeding, provide a separate breeding tank or a well-established tank with ample hiding spots and
territories. A tank size of at least 75 gallons (284 liters) is recommended to accommodate the breeding pair and their
fry.

Green Terrors are substrate spawners, meaning they lay their eggs on a flat surface. Provide a clean, flat surface such
as a large rock or ceramic tile where the female can lay her eggs. The male will fertilize the eggs, and both parents
will guard the nest.

Before breeding, condition the pair with a high-quality diet rich in protein. Offering live or frozen foods such as
bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia can help prepare the fish for spawning.

The female typically lays a clutch of eggs on the chosen substrate. The eggs will hatch in about 3-5 days. Once hatched,
the fry will remain attached to the substrate for a few more days before becoming free-swimming.

Green Terror fry are relatively easy to care for. Provide a suitable environment with fine substrate and minimal water
flow to prevent the fry from being swept away. Feed the fry with small, nutrient-rich foods such as infusoria, powdered
fry food, or finely crushed pellets.

Both parents often take part in guarding and caring for the fry. However, it’s common for Green Terrors to become more
aggressive during the breeding period. Monitor their behavior and be prepared to separate them if aggression towards the
fry or each other becomes excessive.

Regularly check water parameters to ensure they remain within optimal ranges. Maintain a stable environment to prevent
stress and disease during the breeding process.
