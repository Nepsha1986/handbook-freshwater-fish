## Overview

_Cyphotilapia frontosa_, commonly known as the Frontosa Cichlid, is a large and striking fish native to Lake Tanganyika
in East Africa. This species is renowned for its impressive size, distinctive nuchal hump (a fleshy protrusion on the
forehead), and peaceful nature. Frontosa Cichlids are admired for their majestic appearance and can make a dramatic
addition to a large aquarium.

## Tank Requirements

Frontosa Cichlids require a spacious aquarium due to their large size, with a minimum volume of 300 liters recommended.
They thrive in a temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 7.5 and 9.0. The tank should have a substrate of
sand or fine gravel and include plenty of rocks and caves to create hiding spots and territories. Robust filtration is
essential to maintain water quality, and regular water changes of 20-30% weekly are necessary.

## Feeding and Diet

_Cyphotilapia frontosa_ is an omnivorous species with a diet that should include high-quality cichlid pellets, flakes,
and occasional live or frozen foods such as fish, shrimp, and worms. In the wild, they feed on smaller fish and
invertebrates. Providing a varied diet will help maintain their health and enhance their natural coloration. Feed them
2-3 times a day, ensuring that portions are appropriate to avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Frontosa Cichlids involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. Perform regular
water changes and monitor the fish for common health issues such as ich or fin rot. Their peaceful demeanor makes them
suitable for community tanks with other large, non-aggressive species. Due to their territorial nature, providing ample
hiding spots and space is crucial to reduce stress and prevent conflicts.

## Compatibility

_Cyphotilapia frontosa_ is generally peaceful but can be territorial, especially during breeding. They are best kept
with other large, robust fish that can tolerate their size and temperament. Suitable tank mates include other cichlids
from Lake Tanganyika and larger species that are not overly aggressive. Avoid housing them with small or overly
aggressive fish to prevent stress and potential conflicts.

## Breeding

Breeding _Cyphotilapia frontosa_ in captivity is possible with the right setup. They are mouthbrooders, meaning the
female carries the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, maintain a temperature around
26-28°C and provide a well-structured tank with ample hiding spots and territories. After spawning, the female will
incubate the eggs and fry in her mouth for about 3-4 weeks. Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed finely
crushed pellets or specialized fry food. Proper care and monitoring are essential for successful breeding and healthy
fry.
