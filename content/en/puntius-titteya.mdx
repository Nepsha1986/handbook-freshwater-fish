## Overview

The Cherry Barb, also known as _Puntius titteya_, belongs to the Cyprinidae family and is known for its striking red
coloration and active behavior. This fish is native to Sri Lanka and prefers slow-moving waters with abundant vegetation
and hiding spots.

## Tank Requirements

A minimum tank volume of 80 liters is recommended for Cherry Barbs. Maintain water temperatures between 22°C and 26°C,
with a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH level ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. Provide plenty of plants and hiding
spots to create a comfortable environment.

## Feeding and Diet

Cherry Barbs are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods including dry, frozen, and live foods. Their diet can
include algae-based foods, small insects, and larvae. Feed them twice a day and avoid overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care involves checking water quality and feeding the fish. Weekly maintenance includes performing partial water
changes (up to 25% of the tank volume) and cleaning the tank to maintain cleanliness. Monitor the fish’s health and
consult an aquatic specialist if needed.

## Compatibility

Cherry Barbs are peaceful and get along well with other freshwater fish, such as tetras, gouramis, and other barbs.
Avoid keeping them with aggressive or overly large species that might disrupt their peaceful behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Cherry Barbs in captivity is feasible with the right conditions. Provide ample vegetation and hiding spots for
spawning. The female will lay eggs, which the male will fertilize. After the eggs hatch, maintain water cleanliness and
feed the fry with microscopic food until they are large enough for regular fish food.
