## Overview

Paracheirodon axelrodi, commonly known as the Cardinal Tetra, is a small and visually stunning fish native to the Rio
Orinoco and Rio Negro in South America. Characterized by its brilliant red body and vibrant blue stripes, the Cardinal
Tetra is a favorite among aquarists for its striking appearance and peaceful demeanor. This species is often compared to
the Neon Tetra, but the Cardinal Tetra is distinguished by its more intense coloration.

## Tank Requirements

Cardinal Tetras thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 40 liters. They prefer slightly acidic to
neutral water conditions, with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0, and a temperature range of 24-28°C. Use a soft substrate and
provide plenty of plants, driftwood, and hiding spots to create a natural and secure environment. Good filtration and
regular water changes are crucial to maintaining optimal water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

Paracheirodon axelrodi is an omnivorous fish that enjoys a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small insects, worms,
and plant material. In the aquarium, they will accept high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and live or frozen foods
such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. Offering a diverse diet will help enhance their coloration and ensure
their health and vitality.

## Care and Maintenance

To care for Cardinal Tetras, focus on maintaining stable water conditions and providing a balanced diet. Perform weekly
water changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues like fin rot or
white spot disease, and address any problems promptly. A stable and clean environment is essential for their well-being.

## Compatibility

Cardinal Tetras are known for their peaceful and social nature, making them ideal for community tanks. They get along
well with other small, non-aggressive fish such as other tetras, rasboras, and small cichlids. Avoid housing them with
larger or more aggressive species that may pose a threat. Keeping them in groups of at least six will help them feel
secure and display natural schooling behavior.

## Breeding

Breeding Paracheirodon axelrodi in captivity can be challenging but rewarding. Set up a separate breeding tank with
soft, slightly acidic water and a temperature around 26-28°C. Provide spawning mops or fine-leaved plants for egg
deposition. After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about 3-4
days, and the fry can be fed infusoria or powdered fry food until they are large enough to eat regular foods.
