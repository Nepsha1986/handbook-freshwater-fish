## Overview
The neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) is a small, vibrant freshwater fish renowned for its striking blue body and red stripe. Native to the clear waters of the Amazon Basin in South America, neon tetras are popular in the aquarium trade due to their vivid colors and peaceful nature. They are best kept in schools and add a splash of color to community tanks.

## Tank Requirements
Neon tetras require a well-maintained tank with a minimum volume of 40 liters. The ideal water temperature for neon tetras is between 20-26°C, with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 1-8. A gentle filtration system is recommended to maintain water quality and minimize current. Neon tetras prefer a tank setup with subdued lighting, soft substrate, and plenty of plants and hiding spots to mimic their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet
Neon tetras are omnivorous and have a varied diet in the wild, feeding on small insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In an aquarium, they should be provided with high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. They also benefit from occasional vegetable matter. Feeding them 2-3 times a day in small portions will help keep them healthy and vibrant.

## Care and Maintenance
Neon tetras are relatively easy to care for but require regular maintenance to keep their environment clean. Perform water changes of about 20-30% weekly to maintain optimal water quality. Monitor water parameters frequently and clean the tank and filters as needed. Neon tetras are generally healthy but can be susceptible to common diseases like ich and fin rot. Keeping the tank clean and providing a balanced diet will help prevent these issues.

## Compatibility
Neon tetras are peaceful and do well in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. They are best kept in schools of at least six to encourage natural schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include other small, peaceful fish such as guppies, rasboras, and corydoras catfish. Avoid keeping neon tetras with larger or aggressive fish that may see them as prey or disrupt their peaceful nature.

## Breeding
Breeding neon tetras can be challenging and requires specific conditions. To breed neon tetras, provide a separate breeding tank with slightly acidic water (pH 6.0-6.5) and a temperature of around 24-26°C. Use a sponge filter and add plenty of fine-leaved plants or spawning mops for egg-laying. Neon tetras are egg scatterers, so remove the adults after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or finely crushed flakes until they are large enough to eat baby brine shrimp.
