## Overview

The Bristlenose Catfish, also known as the Bristlenose Pleco, belongs to the Loricariidae family and is well-regarded
for its algae-eating abilities and distinctive appearance. Its scientific name is _Ancistrus sp._, and it is
characterized by its bristly nose and compact body. This fish is native to South America and is commonly found in
slow-moving rivers and streams with plenty of hiding spots.

## Tank Requirements

For the Bristlenose Catfish, a tank with a minimum volume of 100 liters is recommended to provide ample space for its
activity. Maintain water temperatures between 22°C and 28°C, and ensure a general hardness (GH) of 5-15 dGH and a pH
level ranging from 6.5 to 7.5. Use a good filter to keep the water clean and a heater to regulate temperature. Provide
hiding spots and smooth substrate to mimic its natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Bristlenose Catfish feed on algae, detritus, and small invertebrates. In captivity, they thrive on a diet
of algae wafers, vegetables like zucchini and cucumber, and occasional protein sources such as bloodworms. Feed them
once or twice a day and ensure that any uneaten food is removed to prevent water quality issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Daily care involves checking the tank’s water quality and feeding the fish. Weekly maintenance includes performing
partial water changes (about 25% of the tank volume) and cleaning the tank to prevent algae buildup. Monitor the
Bristlenose Catfish for signs of common health issues such as fin rot or parasites, and consult an aquatic veterinarian
if problems arise.

## Compatibility

Bristlenose Catfish are peaceful and make excellent tank mates for a variety of species. They are generally compatible
with other freshwater fish, including tetras, gouramis, and livebearers. Avoid keeping them with overly aggressive or
fin-nipping species, as well as very small fish that might become prey.

## Breeding

Breeding Bristlenose Catfish in captivity is relatively straightforward. Provide a breeding cave or suitable hiding spot
for the fish to lay their eggs. The male will guard the eggs and the fry after hatching. Maintain water conditions as
per usual, and feed the fry with finely crushed food until they are large enough to eat standard fish food. Regular
water changes and proper tank conditions will support successful breeding and fry development.
