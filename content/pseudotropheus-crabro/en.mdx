## Overview

The Bumblebee Cichlid (_Pseudotropheus crabro_), native to Lake Malawi in East Africa, is a vividly colored cichlid
recognized for its bold black and yellow stripes. Known for its fascinating behavior of cleaning parasites off catfish,
this cichlid is both a beauty and an asset in specialized cichlid setups. Its striking appearance and unique behaviors
make it a popular choice for experienced aquarists.

## Tank Requirements

Bumblebee Cichlids require a spacious tank of at least 200 liters, with a temperature range of 24-28Â°C, pH levels
between 7.5 and 8.5, and hardness (GH) of 10-20. A rocky environment with caves and hiding spots simulates their natural
habitat and allows for territorial boundaries. They appreciate strong water flow and clean, well-oxygenated water.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Bumblebee Cichlids feed on a variety of foods, including algae and parasites on catfish. In the aquarium, a
varied diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, vegetable matter, and occasional protein sources like brine shrimp or
bloodworms is ideal. Avoid overfeeding protein-rich foods, as they can cause digestive issues.

## Care and Maintenance

Weekly water changes of 25-30% are recommended, as Bumblebee Cichlids require stable water quality. These fish are
sensitive to poor conditions, so regular monitoring and maintenance of the tank's environment are necessary.

## Compatibility

Bumblebee Cichlids can be territorial and semi-aggressive, especially during breeding. They are best kept with other
robust African cichlids of similar size and temperament. Avoid keeping them with smaller or more timid fish, as they may
be harassed.

## Breeding

Breeding Bumblebee Cichlids is relatively straightforward, as they are mouthbrooders. The female carries fertilized eggs
in her mouth until they hatch, providing protection for the young. A separate breeding tank with stable conditions and
plenty of hiding spots is recommende
