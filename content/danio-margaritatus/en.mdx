## Overview

Danio margaritatus, commonly known as the Celestial Pearl Danio or Galaxy Rasbora, is a small, vibrant freshwater fish
native to the lakes of Myanmar. It is prized for its striking appearance, with a deep blue body adorned with pearl-like
spots and bright red-orange fins. These fish thrive in well-planted tanks and are a popular choice among aquarists due
to their peaceful nature and captivating colors.

## Tank Requirements

Celestial Pearl Danios require a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum size of 10 gallons. The water temperature
should be kept between 22-26째C (72-79째F), with a pH level ranging from 6.5 to 7.5. They prefer a heavily planted tank
with a soft substrate and low to moderate water flow. It's important to include hiding spots such as rocks or driftwood
to mimic their natural habitat. Good filtration is essential to maintain water quality, but strong currents should be
avoided.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Celestial Pearl Danios feed on small insects, larvae, and plankton. In an aquarium, they should be offered
a varied diet consisting of high-quality flake food, micro pellets, and live or frozen foods such as daphnia, brine
shrimp, and bloodworms. Feeding them small amounts multiple times a day will help maintain their health and vibrant
coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care for Celestial Pearl Danios includes weekly water changes of around 20-30% to keep the water parameters
stable. Monitor the water quality frequently and clean the substrate to prevent waste buildup. These fish are generally
hardy, but they can be sensitive to poor water conditions, so maintaining a clean environment is crucial. Watch for
signs of stress or illness, such as color fading or lethargy, and address any issues promptly.

## Compatibility

Celestial Pearl Danios are peaceful fish that do well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive species.
Suitable tank mates include small tetras, rasboras, and shrimp. They should be kept in groups of at least six to promote
natural schooling behavior. Avoid housing them with larger, aggressive fish that may view them as prey.

## Breeding

Breeding Celestial Pearl Danios in captivity is relatively straightforward. Provide a separate breeding tank with
fine-leaved plants or a spawning mop where females can deposit eggs. The water should be slightly warmer, around 26-28째C
(79-82째F). After spawning, remove the adults to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in 2-3 days, and
the fry can be fed infusoria or finely crushed flake food until they are large enough to eat brine shrimp.
