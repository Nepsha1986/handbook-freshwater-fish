## Overview

Probarbus jullieni, also known as Jullien's Golden Carp or the Isok Barb, is a large freshwater fish native to Southeast
Asia. Found primarily in the rivers of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, this species can reach impressive sizes of
up to 150 cm. Due to its large size and specific environmental requirements, Probarbus jullieni is not commonly kept in
home aquariums but is more suited for large public or specialized tanks. It is also listed as endangered, with
populations declining due to overfishing and habitat destruction.

## Tank Requirements

Due to its size, Probarbus jullieni requires a tank of at least 1000 liters, although larger volumes are recommended for
adults. The water temperature should be maintained between 22-26°C, with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and water hardness (GH) of
5-12. Strong filtration and water movement are essential to mimic the fish’s natural riverine habitat. A sandy
substrate, combined with rocks and large driftwood, helps provide a natural environment. Regular water changes are
necessary to maintain pristine conditions, as this species is sensitive to poor water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Probarbus jullieni feeds on various invertebrates, plant matter, and detritus. In captivity, they can be
fed high-quality pellets, live or frozen foods such as shrimp, and vegetables like spinach or peas. Due to their size,
they require substantial amounts of food, so offering them a balanced diet in regular, measured portions is essential
for maintaining their health and preventing obesity.

## Care and Maintenance

Maintaining water quality is critical for Probarbus jullieni, as they are sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, pH,
and pollution. Regular water changes and the use of a powerful filtration system are necessary to ensure a stable
environment. Due to their large size, they may require extra space and tank reinforcement to prevent them from damaging
the aquarium setup.

## Compatibility

Probarbus jullieni is a peaceful species but may inadvertently harm smaller tank mates due to its size. Therefore, it is
best housed with other large, peaceful fish that share similar water requirements. Keeping them in a species-only tank
or with similarly sized fish from their natural habitat ensures a peaceful environment. Avoid aggressive species that
may stress this relatively gentle giant.

## Breeding

Breeding Probarbus jullieni in captivity is extremely challenging and has rarely been accomplished outside of
specialized facilities. They are migratory spawners in the wild, requiring specific environmental triggers like seasonal
changes and large river systems. Providing such conditions in captivity is difficult. For aquarists who wish to breed
them, creating large breeding ponds with controlled water flow and simulating environmental changes may be necessary.
The fry, if successfully bred, require careful feeding with fine plankton or crushed food.
