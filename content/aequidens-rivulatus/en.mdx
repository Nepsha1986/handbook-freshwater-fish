## Overview

The Blue Acara, scientifically known as _Aequidens rivulatus_, is a bright and popular cichlid native to the freshwater
rivers of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. Known for its vivid green and blue hues with shimmering scales,
these fish can grow up to 30 cm in length. The Blue Acara impresses with its bold appearance and is a favorite among
aquarium hobbyists who appreciate their dynamic personalities and territorial behavior.

These fish are relatively hardy and can adapt to various water conditions, making them suitable for experienced
aquarists. However, they are best kept in a large aquarium with ample space, hiding spots, and a stable environment to
thrive. The Blue Acara can be aggressive, especially during breeding, so careful selection of tankmates and proper tank
management is important.

## Tank Requirements

The Blue Acara is a large and active cichlid that requires sufficient space and specific conditions in the aquarium for
a healthy existence. Here are the key tank requirements for the Blue Acara:

- **Tank Size:** A minimum of 208 liters is recommended for a single fish. For a pair or community, a 284-liter or
  larger tank is ideal to provide ample space and reduce aggression.

- **Temperature:** Maintain the water temperature between 22-27°C.

- **pH Level:** The Blue Acara prefers a pH range of 6.5-8.0, with slightly acidic to neutral water conditions being
  ideal.

- **Hardness:** Soft to moderately hard water, with a general hardness (GH) of 8-20 dGH.

- **Lighting:** Moderate lighting is suitable. While there are no specific lighting requirements, avoid excessively
  bright light sources to reduce stress.

- **Filtration and Aeration:** The Blue Acara produces a large amount of waste, so a powerful filtration system is
  needed to maintain water quality. Good aeration and water movement will help maintain oxygen balance in the
  environment.

These tank requirements will help ensure the health and comfort of the Blue Acara in captivity.

## Feeding and Diet

The Blue Acara is omnivorous and in the wild feeds on a variety of food, including insects, crustaceans, plant matter,
and small fish. In captivity, it is important to provide a varied diet for their health and vibrant coloration.

The primary diet should consist of high-quality cichlid pellets or flakes. These commercial foods are specially
formulated to meet the nutritional needs of cichlids and help enhance their natural colors.

### Protein Sources

Supplement their diet with protein-rich foods, such as:

- Live or frozen foods like tubifex worms, brine shrimp, and daphnia.
- Insects like crickets and mealworms, either live or dried.
- Small pieces of fish or shrimp.

### Plant Matter

Include plant matter to mimic their natural diet. Offer blanched vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or peas.
Spirulina-based foods are also beneficial for providing necessary nutrients and fiber.

### Feeding Frequency

Feed the Blue Acara 1-2 times per day, offering only as much food as they can consume in a few minutes. This helps avoid
overfeeding and maintains water quality.

### Nutritional Considerations

- Avoid overfeeding fatty or oily foods, as this can lead to health problems.
- Remove any uneaten food promptly to prevent water contamination.

## Care and Maintenance

- Perform weekly water changes of 25-30% to maintain water quality and reduce waste accumulation. Regular changes help
  prevent issues related to ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates.

- Regularly check water parameters, such as pH, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, and hardness. Adjust the parameters as
  needed to maintain conditions within the recommended range for the Blue Acara.

- Clean the substrate during water changes to remove debris and uneaten food, which can contribute to poor water
  quality.

- Clean or replace filter media as necessary to ensure effective filtration. Follow the manufacturer's maintenance
  schedule.

### Substrate and Decor

Ensure that the aquarium is well-decorated with hiding spots, rocks, and caves to create territorial boundaries and
reduce stress. Use sand or fine gravel that will not damage the fish's body. Provide plenty of hiding spots and
territories with rocks, caves, driftwood, and plants. Make sure the decor is securely anchored to prevent it from
toppling, as the Blue Acara may dig or move elements in the tank.

## Compatibility

The Blue Acara is known for its determined and sometimes aggressive behavior, so selecting compatible tankmates is
important. They are best suited for tanks with other large and robust fish that can handle their territorial nature.

Ideal companions for the Blue Acara include other large cichlids like Oscars, Severums, and other aggressive or
semi-aggressive species. They can also be kept with large catfish or larger barbs that are not overly territorial or
aggressive.

**Small or delicate fish are not suitable companions for the Blue Acara.** Avoid species that may be intimidated or
chased, such as small tetras, gouramis, or peaceful schooling fish.

During breeding, the Blue Acara can become especially aggressive and territorial. It is recommended to either separate
breeding pairs or provide ample space and hiding spots to minimize conflicts with other aquarium inhabitants.

If you are keeping the Blue Acara in a community tank, ensure that the tank is large enough to meet the needs of all
inhabitants and reduce the risk of aggression. Providing plenty of hiding spots and visual barriers can help mitigate
territorial disputes.

## Breeding

Breeding the Blue Acara can be an exciting experience for experienced aquarists but requires careful attention due to
their territorial and aggressive nature. Here’s what you need to know for successful Blue Acara breeding:

To stimulate breeding, provide a separate breeding tank or a well-established tank with enough hiding spots and
territories. A tank of at least 284 liters is recommended for housing a pair and their offspring.

The Blue Acara spawns on a flat surface. Provide a clean, flat surface like a large stone or ceramic tile where the
female can lay her eggs. The male will fertilize the eggs, and both parents will guard the nest.

Before breeding, feed the pair high-quality, protein-rich food. Offering live or frozen foods like tubifex worms, brine
shrimp, and daphnia can help prepare the fish for spawning.

The female typically lays the egg clutch on the chosen surface. The eggs will hatch in about 3-5 days. After hatching,
the larvae will remain attached to the substrate for a few days before becoming free-swimming.

Blue Acara larvae are relatively easy to care for. Provide a suitable environment with fine substrate and minimal water
movement to prevent the larvae from being swept away. Feed the larvae small, nutritious food such as infusoria, powdered
larvae food, or finely crushed pellets.

Both parents are often involved in guarding and caring for the offspring. However, the Blue Acara can become more
aggressive during breeding. Watch their behavior and be ready to separate them if aggression towards the offspring or
each other becomes excessive.

Regularly check water parameters to ensure they remain within optimal ranges. Maintain stable conditions to prevent
stress and disease during the breeding process.
