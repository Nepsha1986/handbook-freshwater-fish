## Overview

Nannostomus mortenthaleri, commonly referred to as the Coral Red Pencilfish or Red Arc Pencilfish, is a stunningly
colorful and peaceful freshwater species native to the slow-moving waters of the Peruvian Amazon. These small fish,
reaching a maximum size of about 3-4 cm, are prized for their striking red and black coloration, making them a popular
choice for planted and nano aquariums. Their elongated, slender bodies and unique horizontal stripe pattern add a touch
of elegance to any tank setup.

## Tank Requirements

Coral Red Pencilfish thrive in well-maintained tanks with a minimum volume of 60 liters. They prefer warm water
temperatures between 24-28°C, soft water with a general hardness (GH) of 1-10, and a slightly acidic pH level ranging
from 5.0 to 7.0. These fish do best in heavily planted aquariums that mimic their natural habitat, with plenty of hiding
spots and subdued lighting. Floating plants can be used to create shaded areas, which they enjoy. A gentle water flow
and good filtration are essential to maintain clean water and stable conditions.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Nannostomus mortenthaleri primarily feed on small invertebrates and zooplankton. In the aquarium, they
should be offered a varied diet consisting of high-quality micro pellets, flakes, and live or frozen foods such as
daphnia, brine shrimp, and mosquito larvae. Due to their small size, it's important to provide appropriately sized food
particles. Feed them 2-3 times daily, ensuring they receive adequate nutrition to maintain their vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Coral Red Pencilfish are relatively easy to care for if their water quality is consistently maintained. Regular weekly
water changes of 20-30% are recommended to keep the tank environment healthy. These fish are sensitive to water
conditions, so it's crucial to monitor parameters regularly. They are peaceful and best kept in groups of at least 6-8
individuals, which helps reduce stress and encourages natural schooling behavior. Keep an eye out for signs of stress or
illness, such as faded colors or lethargy, and take prompt action if necessary.

## Compatibility

Nannostomus mortenthaleri is a peaceful species that does well in community tanks with other small, non-aggressive fish.
Suitable tank mates include small tetras, dwarf cichlids, and other peaceful species that thrive in similar water
conditions. Avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish, as Coral Red Pencilfish can be shy and may be outcompeted
for food. Their calm nature makes them an excellent addition to a well-planted community aquarium.

## Breeding

Breeding Nannostomus mortenthaleri in captivity can be challenging but is achievable with the right conditions. A
separate breeding tank with soft, acidic water and a temperature of around 26-28°C is recommended. Provide fine-leaved
plants or spawning mops for the fish to lay their eggs. Once spawning occurs, remove the adults to prevent them from
eating the eggs. The eggs typically hatch in 24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed infusoria or liquid fry food until they
are large enough to consume baby brine shrimp or finely crushed flakes.
