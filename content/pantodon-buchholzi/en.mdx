## Overview

**Pantodon buchholzi**, commonly known as the **African Butterfly Fish**, is a fascinating species native to the
slow-moving waters of West and Central Africa. This fish is instantly recognizable by its large pectoral fins, which
resemble butterfly wings, and its habit of staying near the surface of the water. Growing to a size of 10-12 cm, the
African Butterfly Fish is a predatory species that feeds on small insects and fish.

## Tank Requirements

The **African Butterfly Fish** requires a tank of at least 100 liters with a temperature range of 24-28°C, a pH level
between 6.0 and 7.5, and general water hardness (GH) of 5-15. It prefers a tank with a lot of surface cover, such as
floating plants, and minimal water movement. A secure lid is essential, as this species is known for its ability to jump
out of the water when startled.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Pantodon buchholzi** feeds on insects and small fish near the surface of the water. In an aquarium, they
can be fed a variety of live or frozen foods, such as bloodworms, small crickets, and shrimp. While they may take
floating pellets, they often prefer live food. Feed them once or twice a day, making sure the food remains at the
surface, where they naturally hunt.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for **African Butterfly Fish** requires a stable environment. Regular water changes (20-25% weekly) are important
to keep the water quality high. Due to their unique behavior, it is important to monitor the surface of the tank and
ensure they have enough cover. Avoid rapid water movements, as they prefer calm surfaces.

## Compatibility

This species is generally peaceful but can be territorial towards other surface dwellers. It should not be housed with
small fish, which may be mistaken for food. Suitable tank mates include peaceful mid- to bottom-dwelling species such as
catfish or larger tetras. Avoid fast or aggressive fish that could stress the butterfly fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Pantodon buchholzi** in captivity is possible but challenging. Males and females can be identified by the
males' longer anal fins. To encourage spawning, raise the water temperature slightly to 26-28°C and provide dense
surface vegetation. The female will release eggs at the water surface, which the male fertilizes. The eggs should be
removed to a separate tank to avoid predation. The fry can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp.
