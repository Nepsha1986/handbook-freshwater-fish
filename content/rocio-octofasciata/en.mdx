## Overview

The Jack Dempsey (Rocio octofasciata) is a species of cichlid native to Central America, found in slow-moving waters
such as rivers, lakes, and swamps. This fish is named after the famous boxer Jack Dempsey due to its aggressive nature.
Jack Dempseys are known for their vibrant blue, green, and purple coloration, with males being more colorful than
females. They can grow up to 20 cm in length and are best suited for experienced aquarists due to their territorial
behavior.

## Tank Requirements

Jack Dempseys require a tank of at least 200 liters to accommodate their size and territorial nature. The ideal water
temperature is between 24-28°C, with a pH level of 7.0-8.0 and water hardness (GH) between 8-12. A strong filtration
system is necessary to maintain water quality, and a heater is recommended to keep the temperature stable. The tank
should be decorated with rocks, caves, and plants to provide hiding spots, but ensure there is ample open space for
swimming.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Jack Dempseys are omnivores, feeding on insects, worms, and small fish. In an aquarium setting, they should
be provided with a varied diet consisting of high-quality pellets, frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, brine
shrimp, and earthworms. It’s important to feed them twice a day, offering enough food that can be consumed within a few
minutes to prevent overfeeding.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular care includes weekly water changes of 20-30% to maintain water quality. Monitor water parameters regularly to
ensure they remain within the ideal range. Jack Dempseys are prone to diseases such as Ich, especially if water quality
is poor, so it's crucial to keep the tank clean and well-maintained. Regularly check for signs of stress or illness,
such as color fading or loss of appetite, and address issues promptly.

## Compatibility

Jack Dempseys are known for their aggressive and territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They are best kept
with other large, robust fish that can hold their own, such as other large cichlids. Avoid housing them with small,
timid species, as they may be bullied or eaten. It’s essential to provide plenty of hiding spots and establish
territories within the tank to minimize aggression.

## Breeding

Breeding Jack Dempseys can be challenging due to their aggressive nature. They are egg layers and will often dig pits in
the substrate where the female will lay her eggs. To encourage breeding, maintain the water temperature around 26-28°C
and provide flat rocks or other surfaces for egg-laying. After spawning, the parents will fiercely guard their eggs and
fry. It’s advisable to separate the fry from the parents once they are free-swimming to prevent them from being eaten.
