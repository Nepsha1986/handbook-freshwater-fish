## Overview

_Aulonocara nyassae_, commonly known as the Malawian Peacock or Peacock Cichlid, is a beautiful and vividly colored
cichlid native to Lake Malawi in Africa. This species is highly popular among aquarists due to its stunning coloration,
which includes various shades of blue, yellow, orange, and red. The Malawian Peacock is relatively peaceful for a
cichlid and can be a vibrant addition to a community tank.

## Tank Requirements

Malawian Peacocks thrive in well-maintained aquariums with a minimum volume of 150 liters. They prefer a temperature
range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 7.8 and 8.6, mimicking the alkaline waters of Lake Malawi. The tank should
include plenty of rocks and caves to provide hiding spots and territories for the fish. A sandy substrate is ideal, as
it closely resembles their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to maintain water
quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Aulonocara nyassae_ is an omnivorous species that requires a varied diet. In the wild, they feed on small invertebrates
and crustaceans found in the sandy substrate. In the aquarium, they will readily accept high-quality flake food,
pellets, and occasional live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms. It is important to provide a balanced
diet to maintain their health and vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

To care for Malawian Peacocks, focus on maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform weekly
water changes of 20-30% to keep the water clean and healthy. Monitor the fish for common health issues such as ich or
bloat and address any problems promptly. Providing a stress-free environment with ample hiding places will help prevent
aggressive behaviors and promote overall well-being.

## Compatibility

_Aulonocara nyassae_ is relatively peaceful compared to other cichlids but can still display territorial behavior,
especially during breeding. They are best kept with other peaceful Malawi cichlids of similar size and temperament.
Avoid housing them with very aggressive species or fish that are significantly smaller, as they may become targets of
aggression. A mixed community of peaceful cichlids can create a visually stunning and dynamic aquarium environment.

## Breeding

Breeding _Aulonocara nyassae_ in captivity can be achieved with the right setup. They are maternal mouthbrooders,
meaning the female will carry the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage breeding, provide a
well-decorated tank with plenty of hiding spots and a temperature around 26-28°C. After spawning, the female will carry
the eggs for about 21-28 days until the fry are released. The fry can be fed finely crushed flake food or specialized
fry food once they are free-swimming.
