## Introduction

**Aulonocara nyassae**, commonly known as the Peacock Cichlid, is one of the most beautiful cichlids from Lake Malawi.
Its vibrant colors and graceful movements make it a true gem in any aquarium. This species belongs to the "peacock
cichlid" group, named for its dazzling, iridescent appearance, which is especially striking in males.

Aulonocara nyassae is a relatively peaceful cichlid, suitable for community tanks with other Malawi cichlids. They grow
to 12-15 cm in length and have a lifespan of 8-10 years in captivity with proper care.

## Species Highlights

### Appearance

Male Aulonocara nyassae are breathtakingly colorful, with bodies that shimmer in shades of blue, turquoise, and gold.
Their fins often feature bright orange or yellow accents. Females, on the other hand, are more subdued, with gray-brown
bodies and faint vertical stripes.

### Behavior

Aulonocara nyassae are calm and graceful fish that spend most of their time in the middle and lower levels of the water.
They enjoy sifting through the substrate for food and hiding among rocks and caves.

## Aquarium Setup

### Water Parameters

- **Temperature:** 24-28Â°C
- **pH:** 7.5-8.5
- **Hardness (GH):** 10-20 dGH

### Tank Setup

1. **Tank Size:** At least 200 liters for a group of 5-6 individuals.
2. **Substrate:** Sand or fine gravel to mimic their natural habitat.
3. **Hiding Spots:** Rocks, caves, and grottos to create natural territorial boundaries.
4. **Plants:** Hardy species like Anubias or Vallisneria that can withstand cichlid activity.

**Tip:** Use coral sand or add crushed coral to the filter to maintain a high pH level.

## Feeding

Aulonocara nyassae are omnivores, but in the wild, they primarily feed on small invertebrates found in the sand. In an
aquarium, their diet should include:

- **Staple Food:** High-quality pellets or flakes for Malawi cichlids.
- **Supplemental Foods:**
- Live or frozen foods (brine shrimp, bloodworms, krill).
- Spirulina-based foods to enhance their vibrant colors.
- **Feeding Frequency:** 1-2 times daily.

**Important:** Avoid overfeeding to prevent water quality issues.

## Compatibility

Aulonocara nyassae are relatively peaceful cichlids that get along well with other Malawi species. Ideal tank mates
include:

- **Other Aulonocara species**.
- **Labidochromis** (e.g., Yellow Labidochromis).
- **Peaceful Haplochromis**.

**Avoid:** Keeping them with aggressive species like Mbuna, which can cause stress.

## Breeding

Breeding Aulonocara nyassae in captivity is a fascinating process. They are mouthbrooders:

1. **Spawning:** The male attracts the female with his bright colors and dancing. After spawning, the female collects
   the eggs in her mouth, where they incubate for 2-3 weeks.
2. **Fry Care:** After hatching, the fry remain in the female's mouth for a few more days. They can then be fed baby
   brine shrimp or crushed flakes.

**Tip:** Keep one male with several females to reduce aggression and increase breeding success.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Aggression Between Fish:**

- Ensure the tank is spacious enough.
- Add more hiding spots to divide territories.

2. **Loss of Vibrant Colors:**

- Check water quality and diet.
- Add foods high in carotenoids (e.g., spirulina).

3. **Stress in Fish:**

- Avoid sudden changes in water parameters.
- Ensure proper filtration and aeration.

## Conclusion

Aulonocara nyassae is a true jewel of Lake Malawi, bringing vibrant colors and graceful beauty to your aquarium. Its
peaceful nature and fascinating behavior make it an excellent choice for cichlid enthusiasts. Provide it with the right
environment, and it will reward you with its stunning presence for years to come!
