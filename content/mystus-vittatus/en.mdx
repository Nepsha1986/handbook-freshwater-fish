## Overview

The Striped Dwarf Catfish (_Mystus vittatus_), a native of South and Southeast Asia, is a small, peaceful catfish
species admired for its slender body and distinctive horizontal stripes. It is primarily nocturnal and enjoys a
well-structured habitat with ample hiding spots. This resilient fish is popular among aquarists due to its easy
maintenance and adaptability to various tank environments.

## Tank Requirements

A tank of at least 80 liters is suitable for the Striped Dwarf Catfish, with a water temperature of 22-28Â°C, pH of
6.0-7.5, and general hardness (GH) between 5-15. Provide a tank with subdued lighting, dense vegetation, and caves or
other hiding spots to help the fish feel secure. Ensure good water flow and filtration, as this species prefers
well-oxygenated water.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, this catfish is an omnivore, feeding on insects, small invertebrates, and plant material. In an aquarium
setting, it will accept high-quality sinking pellets, frozen or live foods such as bloodworms, and finely chopped
vegetables. Feeding should take place in the evening to align with its nocturnal nature.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes and a good filtration system are essential for maintaining water quality for this active fish.
Conduct weekly water changes of 20-25% to keep the environment clean. This species is generally hardy but should be
monitored for common health issues, such as skin lesions or fungal infections, especially if tank conditions
deteriorate.

## Compatibility

The Striped Dwarf Catfish is peaceful and compatible with other small, non-aggressive fish. It prefers a community tank
with similarly sized species like tetras, rasboras, or other small catfish. Avoid housing it with aggressive or
territorial fish, as it may become stressed.

## Breeding

Breeding _Mystus vittatus_ in captivity is challenging, as they require specific conditions and can be selective about
mates. In a breeding setup, provide fine plants and hiding spaces. The species is an egg scatterer, and the fry may
require isolation and special care with finely powdered food.
