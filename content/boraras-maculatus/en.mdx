## Overview

Boraras maculatus, commonly known as the Dwarf Rasbora or Spotted Rasbora, is a small freshwater fish native to
slow-moving waters in Southeast Asia. With a maximum size of 1.5-2 cm, this species is one of the smallest available for
aquarists, making it ideal for nano tanks and peaceful community aquariums. Boraras maculatus displays a vibrant red
body with black spots and thrives in well-planted tanks with gentle water movement.

## Tank Requirements

Dwarf Rasboras are highly adaptable to smaller tanks, with a minimum volume of 20 liters. The ideal water temperature is
between 22-28°C, with a pH range of 5.0-7.0 and a general hardness (GH) of 2-12. Boraras maculatus prefers soft,
slightly acidic water and a well-planted aquarium to provide them with ample hiding spaces and comfort. Floating plants
are also recommended to diffuse light, as they appreciate a dimmer environment. A gentle filter that doesn't create
strong currents is essential to replicate their natural habitat.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, Boraras maculatus feed on tiny invertebrates, zooplankton, and insect larvae. In captivity, they will
readily eat high-quality micro-pellets, crushed flakes, and small live or frozen foods such as daphnia, brine shrimp,
and micro-worms. A varied diet ensures optimal health and helps enhance their natural colors. Feed them small portions
twice a day to avoid overfeeding, especially in smaller tanks.

## Care and Maintenance

Boraras maculatus is a hardy species that is easy to care for, making it suitable for beginner aquarists. Regular water
changes of about 20-25% weekly are essential to maintain water quality. They are sensitive to sudden changes in water
conditions, so stability is key. Due to their small size, ensure the tank is securely covered to prevent jumping.
Additionally, avoid keeping them with larger or aggressive fish that may see them as prey.

## Compatibility

Dwarf Rasboras are peaceful and best kept in schools of at least 8-10 individuals to reduce stress and encourage their
natural schooling behavior. Suitable tank mates include other small, peaceful species such as smaller rasboras, tetras,
shrimp, and snails. Avoid housing them with larger or aggressive fish, as their small size makes them vulnerable. A
well-planned community tank with similar species ensures a peaceful environment where they can thrive.

## Breeding

Breeding Boraras maculatus is achievable in captivity, though it can be challenging. A separate breeding tank with soft,
acidic water (pH 5.0-6.5) and a temperature of 26-28°C is recommended. Dense plant cover, such as fine-leaved plants or
spawning mops, is crucial for egg laying. The female will scatter her eggs among the plants, and the male will fertilize
them. After spawning, the adults should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The eggs will hatch in about
24-36 hours, and the fry can be fed with infusoria or liquid fry food until they are large enough to consume baby brine
shrimp.
