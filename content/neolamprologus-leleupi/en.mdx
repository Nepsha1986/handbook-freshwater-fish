## Overview

**Neolamprologus leleupi**, commonly known as the Lemon Cichlid, is a brightly colored cichlid native to the rocky
shores of Lake Tanganyika in Africa. With its striking yellow coloration, it adds a vibrant touch to the aquarium.
Reaching a size of 9-12 cm, it is a territorial species, best kept with other cichlids from the same lake.

With a lifespan of 8-10 years, **Neolamprologus leleupi** is moderately challenging to care for, making it suitable for
aquarists with some experience. It thrives in a species-specific or Tanganyika biotope tank.

## Tank Requirements

**Neolamprologus leleupi** requires a well-structured aquarium with plenty of hiding places among rocks and caves. A
tank of at least 100 liters is recommended, with a water temperature of 23-27Â°C, a pH range of 7.5-9.0, and a general
hardness (GH) of 7-20.

Strong filtration and regular water changes are important to maintain water quality, as this species is sensitive to
fluctuations in water parameters. Mimicking their natural rocky habitat will help reduce territorial aggression.

## Feeding and Diet

In the wild, **Neolamprologus leleupi** feeds on small invertebrates and zooplankton. In the aquarium, they can be fed
high-quality pellets, flakes, and frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms. A varied diet will
help maintain their health and vibrant color.

## Care and Maintenance

Regular water changes and good filtration are essential for the health of **Neolamprologus leleupi**. They can be
sensitive to poor water quality, so maintaining stable water parameters is crucial. Territorial behavior is common, so
providing ample hiding spots will reduce stress and aggression.

This species can be kept with other Tanganyikan cichlids of similar size and temperament. Avoid housing them with small,
non-aggressive species that may be bullied.

## Compatibility

**Neolamprologus leleupi** is best suited for a Tanganyika biotope tank with other species from the same lake, such as
Julidochromis, Altolamprologus, or shell-dwelling cichlids. Tank mates should be carefully chosen to avoid conflicts, as
this species can be aggressive, especially during breeding.

They are not recommended for community aquariums with delicate or slow-moving fish.

## Breeding

Breeding **Neolamprologus leleupi** is possible in the home aquarium. They are cave spawners, and pairs will select a
secluded spot among rocks for spawning. The female will lay eggs on a flat surface inside the cave, and both parents
will guard the eggs and fry.

Once the fry are free-swimming, they can be fed baby brine shrimp or finely crushed flake food. Parental care can
continue for several weeks, but it is important to monitor the parents for signs of aggression towards the fry as they
grow.
