## Overview

_Labidochromis caeruleus_, commonly known as the Electric Yellow Cichlid or Yellow Lab, is a strikingly vibrant species
native to the rocky shorelines of Lake Malawi in Africa. Renowned for its bright yellow coloration, this fish is a
popular choice among cichlid enthusiasts. Despite being a cichlid, the Electric Yellow Cichlid is relatively peaceful,
making it suitable for community tanks with other similarly sized fish.

## Tank Requirements

Electric Yellow Cichlids thrive in a well-maintained aquarium with a minimum volume of 120 liters. They prefer a
temperature range of 24-28°C and a pH level between 7.8 and 8.6, replicating the alkaline waters of Lake Malawi. The
tank should include plenty of rocks and caves to provide hiding spots and territory for the fish. A sandy substrate is
ideal, as it closely resembles their natural habitat. Good filtration and regular water changes are essential to
maintain water quality.

## Feeding and Diet

_Labidochromis caeruleus_ is an omnivorous species that requires a balanced diet. In the wild, they feed on algae,
invertebrates, and small crustaceans. In the aquarium, they will readily accept high-quality flake food, pellets, and
occasional live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia. It's important to include a variety of vegetable-based
foods in their diet to mimic their natural feeding habits and maintain their vibrant coloration.

## Care and Maintenance

Caring for Electric Yellow Cichlids involves maintaining stable water conditions and providing a varied diet. Perform
regular water changes of 20-30% weekly to ensure a clean and healthy environment. Monitor the fish for common health
issues, such as ich or bloat, and address any problems promptly. Providing a stress-free environment with ample hiding
places will help prevent aggressive behaviors and promote overall well-being.

## Compatibility

_Labidochromis caeruleus_ is relatively peaceful compared to other cichlids but can still display territorial behavior,
especially during breeding. They are best kept with other Malawi cichlids of similar size and temperament. Avoid housing
them with very aggressive species or fish that are significantly smaller, as they may become targets of aggression. A
mixed community of peaceful cichlids can create a visually stunning and dynamic aquarium environment.

## Breeding

Breeding _Labidochromis caeruleus_ is relatively straightforward and can be done in captivity with the right setup. They
are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning the female will carry the eggs and fry in her mouth for protection. To encourage
breeding, provide a well-decorated tank with plenty of hiding spots and a temperature around 26-28°C. After spawning,
the female will carry the eggs for about 21-28 days until the fry are released. The fry can be fed finely crushed flake
food or specialized fry food once they are free-swimming.
